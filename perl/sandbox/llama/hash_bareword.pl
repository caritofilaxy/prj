#any bareword (a sequence of nothing but letters, digits, and underscores not starting with a digit, but optionally prefixed with plus or minus) to the left of the big arrow is implicitly quoted. So you can leave off the quote marks on a bareword to the left of the big arrow. You may also omit the quote marks if thereâ€™s nothing but a bareword as a key inside the curly braces of a hash
