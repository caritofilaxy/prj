1
00:00:19,366 --> 00:00:22,603
<i>Long ago,
in ancient China.</i>

2
00:00:22,876 --> 00:00:26,112
<i>The Peacocks rueld over Gongmen city.</i>

3
00:00:26,983 --> 00:00:30,551
<i>They brought great joy,
and prosperity to the city.</i>

4
00:00:30,937 --> 00:00:34,174
<i>For they have invented,
'Fireworks'.</i>

5
00:00:37,481 --> 00:00:39,934
<i>But thier son, Lord Shen..</i>

6
00:00:40,176 --> 00:00:43,705
<i>Saw darker power.. In the fireworks.</i>

7
00:00:44,801 --> 00:00:47,025
<i>What had brought color and joy..</i>

8
00:00:47,919 --> 00:00:51,289
<i>Could also bring darkness and destruction.</i>

9
00:00:52,245 --> 00:00:55,432
<i>Shen's troubled parents consulted to Soothsayer.</i>

10
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:57,509
<i>She for told..</i>

11
00:00:57,916 --> 00:01:01,392
<i>That if Shen continued,
holding his dark path..</i>

12
00:01:01,962 --> 00:01:06,651
<i>He would be defeated by a warrior
of black and white.</i>

13
00:01:07,577 --> 00:01:10,930
<i>The young Lord,
set out to change his fate.</i>

14
00:01:11,629 --> 00:01:13,210
<i>But what he did next..</i>

15
00:01:14,251 --> 00:01:16,604
<i>Only sealed it.</i>

16
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:24,974
<i>Shen returned to his parents,
full of pride.</i>

17
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:27,160
<i>But in their faces..</i>

18
00:01:27,357 --> 00:01:29,411
<i>He saw only horror.</i>

19
00:01:31,377 --> 00:01:33,620
<i>He was banned from the city forever.</i>

20
00:01:34,529 --> 00:01:37,110
<i>But shen swore revenge..</i>

21
00:01:37,706 --> 00:01:40,611
<i>Someday, he would return,</i>

22
00:01:40,904 --> 00:01:44,643
<i>And all of China would bow at his feet.</i>

23
00:02:16,095 --> 00:02:17,405
It's almost done, Lord Shen.

24
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:18,810
But we run out of metal.

25
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:24,574
Search the farthest villages.
Find more metal!

26
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:26,999
China will be mine!

27
00:02:29,346 --> 00:02:34,308
Kung-Fu Panda 2
Sub by: Ballen Abdulkarim

28
00:02:37,219 --> 00:02:40,580
And then, the Dragon Warrior
joined the Furious Five!

29
00:02:40,581 --> 00:02:43,534
And then they became the most
awesome Kung-Fu team ever!

30
00:02:43,967 --> 00:02:45,374
Enough talk, let's fight!

31
00:02:47,363 --> 00:02:50,607
Listen, listen! You can hear the
Dragon Warrior training, right now!

32
00:02:50,608 --> 00:02:51,266
<i>33..</i>

33
00:02:51,698 --> 00:02:53,427
<i>Stop doing that.
This is too dangerous!</i>

34
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,160
<i>Look at the bottom.
Stay focused!</i>

35
00:02:55,492 --> 00:02:57,225
<i>36..</i>

36
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:57,499
<i>- 37!
- 37.</i>

37
00:02:57,885 --> 00:03:00,262
How is he doing that?
Look at his face!

38
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:06,850
38 bean bons!

39
00:03:06,851 --> 00:03:08,129
Yes! New record!

40
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:11,083
- You monster!
- Keep going. Heat forty!

41
00:03:11,084 --> 00:03:11,990
He'll never heat forty!

42
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:14,447
You got it, buddy.
I'm gonna just make it forty!

43
00:03:14,448 --> 00:03:16,903
- Do it!
- No problem!

44
00:03:26,047 --> 00:03:27,526
- Yeah!
- Whoo-hoo!

45
00:03:27,527 --> 00:03:28,632
- Yes!
- You did it!

46
00:03:28,633 --> 00:03:29,959
Will done, Po!

47
00:03:34,046 --> 00:03:36,622
Oh! Master Shifu!
Gotta go. See you later!

48
00:03:36,807 --> 00:03:39,131
- Whoo-hoo, yeah!
- You'll save those for me. Right?

49
00:04:00,101 --> 00:04:01,132
Inner peace.

50
00:04:04,665 --> 00:04:06,771
Inner.. peace.

51
00:04:09,017 --> 00:04:10,216
Uhh!

52
00:04:10,392 --> 00:04:11,843
Inner peace.

53
00:04:12,537 --> 00:04:13,182
Master Shifu!

54
00:04:14,571 --> 00:04:16,640
Master Shifu, what do we got?

55
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:19,811
Priates? Vondle to volcano mountain?

56
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,260
Whatever it is,
I will take them down!

57
00:04:22,769 --> 00:04:24,036
'Cause I'm in a mood.

58
00:04:24,037 --> 00:04:26,101
I need to get something done.
You know what I mean?

59
00:04:27,359 --> 00:04:29,560
Ahh.. What you doing?

60
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:33,293
One of master Hookway's final teachings.

61
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:03,018
Wow!

62
00:05:04,568 --> 00:05:05,591
Awesome!

63
00:05:05,592 --> 00:05:08,340
How did you do that?

64
00:05:08,792 --> 00:05:11,208
- Inner peace.
- Inner peace!

65
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:12,654
That's cool!

66
00:05:13,821 --> 00:05:15,183
Inner peace of what?

67
00:05:15,453 --> 00:05:17,827
It's the next face of your training.

68
00:05:17,828 --> 00:05:23,462
Every master most find his path,
to inner peace.

69
00:05:23,726 --> 00:05:28,192
Some chose to meditate for 50 years,
in a cave just like this!

70
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:33,133
Without the slimmest taste of food.
Or water.

71
00:05:35,221 --> 00:05:35,703
Or...?

72
00:05:35,864 --> 00:05:39,064
Some finds in torture and suffering.
As I did.

73
00:05:39,371 --> 00:05:42,136
On the day you were
choosen as Dragon Warrior,

74
00:05:43,015 --> 00:05:45,008
Was the worst day of my life.

75
00:05:45,586 --> 00:05:46,299
By far.

76
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,298
Nothing else came close.

77
00:05:48,299 --> 00:05:52,606
It was the worst most painful,
mind-destroying, horrible moment..

78
00:05:52,607 --> 00:05:53,580
Okay.

79
00:05:53,581 --> 00:05:55,237
I have ever experienced!

80
00:05:59,441 --> 00:06:02,219
But once I realized, the problem was not you..

81
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,780
But with what in you.

82
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:05,427
I found inner peace.

83
00:06:05,897 --> 00:06:08,475
It was able to harness
the fullthy universe.

84
00:06:09,154 --> 00:06:11,717
So that's it?
I just need inner peace?

85
00:06:11,921 --> 00:06:14,197
My inners are already
super-super peaceful..

86
00:06:14,198 --> 00:06:17,838
So, all I need to do,
is just get this thing going.

87
00:06:17,982 --> 00:06:20,085
Inner peace, you're going down!

88
00:06:20,175 --> 00:06:22,009
Now show me what were you
doing that with your feet.

89
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:23,568
I saw just sort of fancy boots..

90
00:06:23,703 --> 00:06:26,625
Ho! Bandits, approaching the Musician's village

91
00:06:26,788 --> 00:06:27,742
Danger!

92
00:06:27,743 --> 00:06:31,641
Tell those musicians to start playing
some action music, because it is on!

93
00:06:31,805 --> 00:06:34,534
Don't worry, Shifu.
I'll master inner peace, as soon as I get back.

94
00:06:34,535 --> 00:06:36,014
No snack stops this time!

95
00:06:36,015 --> 00:06:38,837
Ha-ha-ha!
Snack stops!

96
00:06:39,158 --> 00:06:40,096
Wait, you serious?

97
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:55,407
Get all the metal,
You could find!

98
00:06:59,342 --> 00:07:00,445
Oh! The metal!

99
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,180
Help! Help! Help! Help!

100
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:13,756
That's everything!
Let's get outta here.

101
00:07:21,462 --> 00:07:23,265
Reached justice!

102
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:39,759
Hmm?

103
00:07:42,722 --> 00:07:43,740
The Dragon Warrior!

104
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:46,043
Panda? That's impossible!

105
00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:48,232
My fist hunger for justice.

106
00:07:49,395 --> 00:07:51,359
That was my.. Fist.

107
00:07:51,608 --> 00:07:52,288
Get 'em!

108
00:07:52,635 --> 00:07:53,667
Come on!

109
00:08:16,978 --> 00:08:17,775
Take that!

110
00:08:29,119 --> 00:08:29,809
It's coming!

111
00:08:30,246 --> 00:08:31,658
Thank you, Mantis.

112
00:08:50,482 --> 00:08:52,305
Tigress, Double Just streak!

113
00:09:01,588 --> 00:09:02,415
Fetch of Fury!

114
00:09:06,836 --> 00:09:07,487
Viper!

115
00:09:08,062 --> 00:09:10,828
Monkey! Viper! Mantis!

116
00:09:11,419 --> 00:09:12,238
Pony!

117
00:09:12,239 --> 00:09:13,239
What?!

118
00:09:14,356 --> 00:09:15,081
Oh, sorry!

119
00:09:23,532 --> 00:09:24,167
Crane, go!

120
00:09:24,328 --> 00:09:25,048
I'm on it!

121
00:09:32,647 --> 00:09:33,418
Wow!

122
00:09:44,661 --> 00:09:45,628
Is everyone OK?

123
00:09:47,154 --> 00:09:48,359
Awesome!

124
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,683
I got this!

125
00:10:04,243 --> 00:10:04,821
Po!

126
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:12,690
Shoo on that, Toby!

127
00:10:22,798 --> 00:10:24,767
Are you Okay?
What happened?

128
00:10:26,352 --> 00:10:27,528
I think I saw..

129
00:10:28,052 --> 00:10:29,179
I think..

130
00:10:30,851 --> 00:10:31,707
I gotta go!

131
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:35,363
Thank you!

132
00:10:35,364 --> 00:10:39,434
Thank you, for coming to
Dragon Warrior Noodles and Tofu.

133
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:41,925
You wanna tea?
Lemon Sauce?

134
00:10:41,926 --> 00:10:44,428
If you need anything,
just ask!

135
00:10:45,803 --> 00:10:46,465
Thank you!

136
00:10:48,107 --> 00:10:51,003
Uhh.. The Dragon Warrior's mop.

137
00:10:51,004 --> 00:10:53,072
He might be very poor!

138
00:10:53,599 --> 00:10:56,242
Don't touch it!
You'll get the mop dirty.

139
00:10:57,195 --> 00:10:58,506
- He was waiting on me.
- Awesome!

140
00:10:59,269 --> 00:11:00,961
Yeah! I have a stand to prove it!

141
00:11:00,962 --> 00:11:03,011
Hey.. Where is the Dragon Warrior?

142
00:11:03,216 --> 00:11:05,794
He doesn't work here anymore.

143
00:11:05,795 --> 00:11:09,083
He is busy out there,
protecting the valley.

144
00:11:09,547 --> 00:11:10,922
The Dragon Warrior!

145
00:11:10,923 --> 00:11:11,967
Po!

146
00:11:14,369 --> 00:11:15,193
Here.

147
00:11:15,194 --> 00:11:16,255
Okay.

148
00:11:16,418 --> 00:11:18,849
- He is the Dragon Warrior!
- You should've told me you're coming.

149
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:19,409
Hi, dad!

150
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,669
I would have get
you some stinky Tofu!

151
00:11:23,397 --> 00:11:25,922
- Dad.. Can I talk to you?
- Of course, son.

152
00:11:27,221 --> 00:11:32,342
Honor of my son..
Free Tofu dessert for everyone.

153
00:11:33,038 --> 00:11:34,062
But with purchases.

154
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:38,208
It's so good to see you, Po!

155
00:11:38,749 --> 00:11:42,606
Have you lost weight?
I could almost put my wings around you!

156
00:11:43,227 --> 00:11:44,202
Ah.. Well, maybe a little.

157
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,039
Oh.. Poor you.
You most feel weak!

158
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,227
- Let me get you some soup.
- Uh.. No. That's okay, dad. I'm not hungry.

159
00:11:50,228 --> 00:11:52,723
Not hungry?!
Are you alright?

160
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:54,055
Yeah, yeah.
No, I'm fine.

161
00:11:54,303 --> 00:11:57,094
It's just, earlier today,
I was fighting bandits.

162
00:11:57,095 --> 00:11:59,806
Nothing too dangerous..

163
00:11:59,974 --> 00:12:01,567
- They were just.. You know.
- Yeah!

164
00:12:01,602 --> 00:12:04,474
And then the strangest thing happened, uh..

165
00:12:04,509 --> 00:12:05,377
I had this crazy vision..

166
00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:09,486
I thinks I saw my mom, and me..
As a baby.

167
00:12:10,145 --> 00:12:12,571
Mom?
A baby?!

168
00:12:12,758 --> 00:12:13,493
Dad...

169
00:12:13,528 --> 00:12:16,059
Wha.. Who.. What you..

170
00:12:17,992 --> 00:12:18,810
How can I say this?

171
00:12:20,687 --> 00:12:22,201
Where did I come from?

172
00:12:26,565 --> 00:12:28,961
Well, you see, son..

173
00:12:28,962 --> 00:12:32,535
Baby come from a little egg..

174
00:12:32,536 --> 00:12:35,253
Don't ask me where the egg comes from.

175
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,091
Dad! It's not what I meant.

176
00:12:38,693 --> 00:12:40,628
I.. I know it's not.

177
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:45,739
I think it's time I told you something,
I should've told you a long time ago.

178
00:12:46,581 --> 00:12:47,828
Okay..

179
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,316
You.. Might have been kind of..

180
00:12:55,606 --> 00:12:56,770
Adopted.

181
00:12:57,173 --> 00:12:58,311
I knew it!

182
00:12:58,312 --> 00:12:59,497
You knew?

183
00:12:59,498 --> 00:13:02,504
- Wha.. Who told you?
- No one. I mean.. come on, dad.

184
00:13:02,505 --> 00:13:05,451
But if you do,
why didn't you ever say anything?

185
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:06,863
Why didn't you say anything?

186
00:13:09,987 --> 00:13:12,422
How did I get here, dad?
Where did I get from?

187
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:17,925
Actually,
You came from this..

188
00:13:21,413 --> 00:13:24,328
It was just another
day at the restaurant.

189
00:13:24,891 --> 00:13:26,205
Time to make the noodles.

190
00:13:26,816 --> 00:13:28,195
And when I went to the back,

191
00:13:28,196 --> 00:13:31,306
Where my vegetables
has just been delivered.

192
00:13:31,782 --> 00:13:34,488
There were cabbages, tunas, radishes..

193
00:13:35,282 --> 00:13:37,284
Only.. There was no radishes!

194
00:13:38,663 --> 00:13:41,967
Just a very hungry baby-panda.

195
00:13:44,463 --> 00:13:45,653
There was no note.

196
00:13:46,415 --> 00:13:48,176
Ofcourse you could've eat meet.

197
00:13:48,309 --> 00:13:51,951
I.. Waited for someone
to come.. Looking for you.

198
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,767
But no one did.

199
00:14:17,425 --> 00:14:19,207
I brought you inside.

200
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:23,743
Feed you.

201
00:14:25,392 --> 00:14:26,376
Give you a bath.

202
00:14:29,598 --> 00:14:31,389
And feed you again!

203
00:14:34,092 --> 00:14:35,186
And again.

204
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:40,019
And tried to put some pants on you.

205
00:14:49,145 --> 00:14:52,817
And then I made the decision,
that would change my life forever.

206
00:14:55,156 --> 00:14:57,810
To make my Secret Ingredient Soup.

207
00:14:58,494 --> 00:15:01,905
And to raise you as my own son.

208
00:15:02,877 --> 00:15:04,477
You, Po.

209
00:15:05,247 --> 00:15:07,003
My little panda.

210
00:15:08,153 --> 00:15:15,059
And from that moment on, both my soup
and my life have been that much sweeter.

211
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:18,940
That's all, Po.
That's the end of the story.

212
00:15:20,949 --> 00:15:23,272
Look at me!
Oh, don't look at me!

213
00:15:23,554 --> 00:15:26,490
That's it?
That can't be it!

214
00:15:27,054 --> 00:15:28,454
That's gotta be more, dad!

215
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:32,384
Well, there was a time you
ate all my bamboo furniture.

216
00:15:33,121 --> 00:15:34,680
It was important too.

217
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:37,882
One dumpling please.
Dragon Warrior's size.

218
00:15:43,564 --> 00:15:47,392
Oh, Po! Your story may
not have such a happy beginning..

219
00:15:47,555 --> 00:15:49,201
But look how it turned out!

220
00:15:49,202 --> 00:15:51,527
You got me.
You got Kung-Fu.

221
00:15:51,528 --> 00:15:53,140
And you got noodles!

222
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,552
I know! I just had so many questions.

223
00:15:55,966 --> 00:15:58,068
Like how did I ever fit in this tiny basket?

224
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,747
Why didn't I like pants?

225
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:03,830
And, who am I?

226
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:13,855
Good.
Watch your thought.

227
00:16:16,201 --> 00:16:16,823
Good!

228
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:51,052
Shen?

229
00:16:52,401 --> 00:16:54,402
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

230
00:16:55,316 --> 00:16:58,015
Now we have got my
parents out of the way..

231
00:16:58,328 --> 00:16:59,891
Please leave my house!

232
00:17:00,118 --> 00:17:01,463
Your house?

233
00:17:01,842 --> 00:17:05,022
Yes, Didn't you see the peacock,
in the front door?

234
00:17:07,278 --> 00:17:09,124
They were so sad.

235
00:17:09,478 --> 00:17:14,196
It seems your fortune is full of darkness
and not as good as you thought.

236
00:17:14,391 --> 00:17:16,465
We shall see, Shen.

237
00:17:16,707 --> 00:17:18,003
Ow.. You shall see a goat.

238
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,330
Well, well..

239
00:17:20,365 --> 00:17:24,393
- What do you want, Shen?
- What is rightfully mine.

240
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:26,058
Gongmen city!

241
00:17:26,261 --> 00:17:29,247
Gongmen is under the stewardship
of the masters council.

242
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:30,578
And we will protect it..

243
00:17:30,712 --> 00:17:32,238
Even from you!

244
00:17:34,274 --> 00:17:36,585
I'm so glad you feel that way.

245
00:17:37,182 --> 00:17:40,220
Otherwise that will drag
that careful enough.

246
00:17:40,632 --> 00:17:42,713
What's in the box, Shen ?

247
00:17:42,905 --> 00:17:43,709
You want to see?

248
00:17:44,517 --> 00:17:45,391
It's a gift!

249
00:17:46,715 --> 00:17:48,067
It is your parting gift.

250
00:17:48,788 --> 00:17:50,054
It mean, it will part you.

251
00:17:50,212 --> 00:17:54,561
Part of you here, part of you there..
And part of you way way there..

252
00:17:54,562 --> 00:17:56,288
Till you gonna hit that wall!

253
00:17:56,418 --> 00:17:57,877
You insanest fool!

254
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:18,136
- Show off.
- That is a warning!

255
00:18:18,826 --> 00:18:21,874
You are no match for our Kung-Fu.

256
00:18:22,097 --> 00:18:22,981
I agree.

257
00:18:23,891 --> 00:18:25,499
But this is!

258
00:18:39,721 --> 00:18:42,361
Are you familiar with
the master of Gongmen city?

259
00:18:42,362 --> 00:18:44,272
- Master thunder Rhino?
- Yes!

260
00:18:44,307 --> 00:18:46,813
- Son of legendary Flying Rhino?
- Yes!

261
00:18:46,814 --> 00:18:49,977
And slayer of the 10,000 Serpens's
in the valey of low!

262
00:18:50,146 --> 00:18:50,830
He's dead!

263
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,524
Tha.. That's impossible!

264
00:18:53,525 --> 00:18:56,228
Rhino's horn defend is
improvise to any technic.

265
00:18:56,229 --> 00:18:57,861
It was no technic!

266
00:18:57,862 --> 00:19:02,434
Lord Shen has created a weapon,
one that breeds firer and spread metal.

267
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:04,128
Unless he is stopped.

268
00:19:04,129 --> 00:19:08,021
This could be
the end of Kung-Fu!

269
00:19:08,497 --> 00:19:10,069
But I just got Kung-Fu!

270
00:19:10,507 --> 00:19:12,484
And now, you most save it!

271
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:16,836
Go! Destroy this weapon,
and bring Lord Shen to justice.

272
00:19:16,837 --> 00:19:18,456
Okay, here we go!
Here we go!

273
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:20,633
Wa-wa-wa-wa.. Wait a second.

274
00:19:20,968 --> 00:19:21,911
How can I do this?

275
00:19:22,581 --> 00:19:25,241
I mean, how can Kung-Fu stop
something that stops Kung-Fu?

276
00:19:25,718 --> 00:19:28,720
Remember, Dragon Warrior.
Anything is possible..

277
00:19:28,941 --> 00:19:30,490
When you have 'Inner peace'.

278
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,364
Inner peace, inner peace,
inner peace.

279
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:40,828
Peace on!

280
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:45,308
Po, Po!
I packed your stuffs.

281
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:51,399
I packed you food for week's cookies,  vegetables,
and I even packed all your actions fingers.

282
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,274
See?

283
00:19:53,949 --> 00:19:56,559
Oh! hey.. I don't know
what those are!

284
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,208
Never seen them before in my life.

285
00:19:58,508 --> 00:20:00,522
Dad, you got scratches on my tigress.

286
00:20:00,523 --> 00:20:04,054
I also packed your paintings
of our best times together.

287
00:20:04,101 --> 00:20:05,918
Just in case you get lonely.

288
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:08,044
That's me and you making noodles.

289
00:20:08,045 --> 00:20:10,174
And that's me and you eating noodles.

290
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:12,721
And that's me giving you
a piggy back ride.

291
00:20:14,865 --> 00:20:15,461
That's cute!

292
00:20:15,462 --> 00:20:17,689
I haven't second thought
about this one.

293
00:20:19,179 --> 00:20:20,056
They're wating for me.

294
00:20:20,057 --> 00:20:23,052
Of course, of course.
You have a job to do.

295
00:20:23,495 --> 00:20:24,269
Far from home.

296
00:20:24,706 --> 00:20:28,321
In a strange city, filled with strange
people and strange noodles.

297
00:20:28,912 --> 00:20:31,979
Facing horrible danger, from which
you have may never return!

298
00:20:32,719 --> 00:20:33,821
Don't go, Po!

299
00:20:34,321 --> 00:20:35,009
I gotta go.

300
00:20:35,524 --> 00:20:38,460
I'm the Dragon Warrior.
It's kind of my job to save Kung-Fu.

301
00:20:39,312 --> 00:20:41,959
And if I don't,
what am I?

302
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,303
You are my son.

303
00:20:47,534 --> 00:20:48,553
Right?

304
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,046
Po, It's time.

305
00:20:51,821 --> 00:20:52,674
Good-bye.

306
00:20:54,899 --> 00:20:56,194
Don't worry, Mr. Ping.

307
00:20:56,195 --> 00:20:58,386
He'll be back before you can say 'Noodles'.

308
00:21:04,456 --> 00:21:05,596
Noodles.

309
00:21:12,655 --> 00:21:15,598
Come on, guys!
Let's go. Yeah!

310
00:21:18,203 --> 00:21:19,924
Right.. Yeah!

311
00:21:20,594 --> 00:21:23,269
Yeah, yeah.. Yeah!

312
00:22:42,941 --> 00:22:43,516
Momma?

313
00:22:49,764 --> 00:22:54,596
Mom? Dad? Is that you?
Mom! Dad!

314
00:22:56,837 --> 00:22:59,703
Oh.. Hi! Hey-Hey..
Son, you are back.

315
00:22:59,704 --> 00:23:00,049
Huh?

316
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,698
Honey, what you doing here?

317
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:06,867
- But I thought..
- We replaced you, dear. with a lovely radish.

318
00:23:07,748 --> 00:23:11,257
- Radish?!
- It's quite, polite, and frankly..

319
00:23:11,787 --> 00:23:12,882
It does better Kung-Fu.

320
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,924
No.. No, no, no!

321
00:23:19,723 --> 00:23:20,250
Wait!

322
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,599
Radish, radish, radish!

323
00:23:46,947 --> 00:23:49,184
Inner pea..

324
00:23:51,626 --> 00:23:52,237
pea..

325
00:23:55,192 --> 00:23:56,875
Inner peace.

326
00:24:13,643 --> 00:24:18,252
Inner peace, inner peace, inner peace...

327
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,783
I'm.. Training.

328
00:24:26,433 --> 00:24:28,570
The mast, is not the worthy opponent.

329
00:24:32,063 --> 00:24:32,985
I'm ready.

330
00:24:33,467 --> 00:24:35,698
Okay..
So series!

331
00:24:44,052 --> 00:24:45,890
I think I prefer the mast.

332
00:24:46,672 --> 00:24:47,630
Apologize.

333
00:24:47,631 --> 00:24:50,793
I used to punch the iron wood
trees by the fist in training.

334
00:24:51,211 --> 00:24:52,585
Now, I feel nothing.

335
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,780
That's severely cool!

336
00:24:58,666 --> 00:24:59,345
Again!

337
00:25:01,838 --> 00:25:06,692
So.. This punching iron wood trees,
how long did you have to do that?

338
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:09,415
- 20 years.
- Oh.. 20.. 20 years!

339
00:25:10,307 --> 00:25:13,539
Is there any.. Uhh.. You know,
faster way.. You know..

340
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,759
Until.. You know..
Don't feel anything?

341
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,540
No!

342
00:25:16,873 --> 00:25:17,695
Besides,

343
00:25:21,581 --> 00:25:24,744
I don't think, hard
style is your thing.

344
00:25:29,304 --> 00:25:29,695
Po..

345
00:25:30,227 --> 00:25:31,565
Why are you really out here?

346
00:25:32,806 --> 00:25:34,921
I just found out, that my dad..

347
00:25:35,174 --> 00:25:36,401
Isn't really my dad.

348
00:25:38,635 --> 00:25:40,172
Your dad,
the goose..

349
00:25:40,512 --> 00:25:42,209
Most have been quite a shock!

350
00:25:43,133 --> 00:25:43,839
Yeah!

351
00:25:44,634 --> 00:25:46,027
And this bothers you?

352
00:25:46,822 --> 00:25:49,407
Are you kidding me?
We're warriors, right?

353
00:25:49,966 --> 00:25:53,841
Nerve's of steel, soul's of Platinum.
Like you.

354
00:25:54,785 --> 00:25:56,134
So hard core, you don't feel anything!

355
00:26:01,047 --> 00:26:03,085
- I was..
- So, what you guys talking about?

356
00:26:03,867 --> 00:26:05,557
Nothing.. Nothing!

357
00:26:05,558 --> 00:26:07,902
Po's having daddy's issues.

358
00:26:07,903 --> 00:26:10,849
I'm so lucky, I dont have
any problem with my dad.

359
00:26:11,285 --> 00:26:13,636
'Cause my mother ate his head,
before I was born.

360
00:26:13,637 --> 00:26:14,432
I don't know!

361
00:26:14,433 --> 00:26:16,143
Mantis, this isn't about you!

362
00:26:16,968 --> 00:26:19,109
Po, is the one freaking out.

363
00:26:19,356 --> 00:26:20,396
I'm not freaking out.

364
00:26:20,674 --> 00:26:21,573
Po..

365
00:26:21,574 --> 00:26:23,155
<i>I'm freaking in.</i>

366
00:26:23,156 --> 00:26:24,604
- Po!
- What?

367
00:26:25,102 --> 00:26:28,031
We're here.
Gongmen city!

368
00:26:44,988 --> 00:26:47,032
My father's throne.

369
00:26:48,087 --> 00:26:50,552
He used to let me play here,
beside him.

370
00:26:50,814 --> 00:26:54,393
Promising with someday
this throne would be mine.

371
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,514
A little to the left.

372
00:27:02,183 --> 00:27:03,953
But it's so heavy, Master.

373
00:27:04,299 --> 00:27:06,702
30 years, I have waited for this moment.

374
00:27:07,666 --> 00:27:10,678
Every thing, most be
exactly how I visioned it.

375
00:27:11,261 --> 00:27:14,205
And I have visioned it
a little to the left.

376
00:27:15,505 --> 00:27:16,895
Perfect!

377
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:20,316
With the weapon, by my side..
A little bit more.

378
00:27:22,423 --> 00:27:28,031
With the weapon, by my side,
all China will bow before me!

379
00:27:28,405 --> 00:27:32,012
We move out in 3 days,
when the moon is full.

380
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:33,797
And the tide is high.

381
00:27:35,482 --> 00:27:38,747
You're down, you old goat,
why don't you tell me my..

382
00:27:38,868 --> 00:27:40,148
Fortune?

383
00:27:40,945 --> 00:27:43,875
The future. I was going to say 'Future'.

384
00:27:45,199 --> 00:27:48,586
Look in to your bowl,
and tell me what glorious waits.

385
00:27:49,972 --> 00:27:53,590
If you continue on your current path,

386
00:27:55,845 --> 00:27:59,987
You will find yourself..
At the bottom of the stairs.

387
00:28:02,797 --> 00:28:03,743
I see...

388
00:28:05,441 --> 00:28:06,676
I see...

389
00:28:08,304 --> 00:28:11,731
I see, pain and anger!

390
00:28:11,922 --> 00:28:15,005
How dare you?
That is the finest suit in the province!

391
00:28:15,006 --> 00:28:16,445
Followed by denial.

392
00:28:16,446 --> 00:28:17,768
This is not fortune telling.

393
00:28:18,216 --> 00:28:20,131
- Now just say what's happening right..
- Now?

394
00:28:22,864 --> 00:28:25,362
The most important time is now.

395
00:28:26,498 --> 00:28:29,447
But if you really want
to see the future.

396
00:28:31,909 --> 00:28:33,556
What do you see?

397
00:28:39,406 --> 00:28:40,582
A peacock..

398
00:28:43,052 --> 00:28:46,503
Is defeated by a warrior,
of black and white.

399
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:50,362
Nothing has chainged!

400
00:28:56,325 --> 00:28:57,819
That's impossible.

401
00:28:58,124 --> 00:28:59,199
And you know it.

402
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,595
It is not impossible,
and he knows it.

403
00:29:02,596 --> 00:29:03,487
Who?

404
00:29:03,713 --> 00:29:06,039
Lord Shen!
I saw a panda.

405
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:06,833
A panda!

406
00:29:09,428 --> 00:29:10,458
A Kunf-Fu warrior.

407
00:29:10,459 --> 00:29:11,988
It fought like a demon!

408
00:29:11,989 --> 00:29:14,541
Big and fury.
Soft and squishy.

409
00:29:14,706 --> 00:29:16,599
Kind of clashing and cuddly.

410
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:20,375
There are no more pandas.

411
00:29:20,731 --> 00:29:23,927
Even with his poor eye sight,
he can see the truth.

412
00:29:24,121 --> 00:29:26,892
Why?
Is it that you can not?

413
00:29:27,898 --> 00:29:30,951
Find this panda,
and bring him to me!

414
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:32,510
Yes, sir!

415
00:29:33,566 --> 00:29:37,069
One panda lives,
that will not make you right

416
00:29:37,646 --> 00:29:41,058
You are right.
Beeing right makes me right!

417
00:29:41,542 --> 00:29:45,157
Then, I will kill him.
And make you wrong.

418
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:49,012
Would you stop that?

419
00:30:01,436 --> 00:30:04,447
That must be Shen's palace,
in the other side of the city.

420
00:30:04,964 --> 00:30:07,298
Great! We will match in the tower, and proclaim;

421
00:30:07,443 --> 00:30:09,714
We are the Dragon Warrior
and the Furious Five,

422
00:30:09,715 --> 00:30:11,598
And we are here to bring you to justice!

423
00:30:15,672 --> 00:30:17,957
What are you doing?
This place is crowling with wolves.

424
00:30:23,459 --> 00:30:25,894
Hey! Isn't that the guy that
hammered you in the face?

425
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,152
I do not like that guy!

426
00:30:31,153 --> 00:30:34,610
We need to get to that to tower,
without being spoted by those wolves.

427
00:30:35,007 --> 00:30:36,177
Got it..

428
00:30:36,178 --> 00:30:37,178
Stealth Mode!

429
00:31:04,791 --> 00:31:06,285
That noodles!

430
00:31:11,232 --> 00:31:12,847
Ow!

431
00:31:12,848 --> 00:31:13,762
Hello!

432
00:31:16,044 --> 00:31:18,259
Yeah, okay.. Anyway.
Where was I?

433
00:31:19,367 --> 00:31:21,870
- Where is, Po?
- How can we lose a guy that big?

434
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:34,428
Guys, guys?

435
00:31:34,748 --> 00:31:36,730
- He-Hey, Po!
- Sorry!

436
00:31:36,731 --> 00:31:38,548
So, that was Stealth Mode, Huh?

437
00:31:38,716 --> 00:31:41,078
Let's be honest,
not one of my stronger modes.

438
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:43,037
We now there is more gold in there.
Come on!

439
00:31:45,298 --> 00:31:48,730
- This rice is raw!
- You stole of my metal pots for Lord Shen!

440
00:31:48,765 --> 00:31:52,953
Either you cook my rice..
Or I cook you.

441
00:31:52,954 --> 00:31:54,826
Po, do something!

442
00:31:55,284 --> 00:31:57,679
How am I suppose to help the
cook-rice, while I'll get caught?

443
00:31:58,124 --> 00:32:01,116
- Wait.. I have a better idea!
- Three, Two, One!

444
00:32:02,194 --> 00:32:03,230
- Hey!
- Hey!

445
00:32:14,452 --> 00:32:16,956
We're here to liberate the city,
and bring Shen to justice.

446
00:32:17,139 --> 00:32:18,124
You will need help!

447
00:32:18,325 --> 00:32:20,156
Thank you brave sheep,
but it's too dangerous..

448
00:32:20,157 --> 00:32:20,777
I can't let you.

449
00:32:20,916 --> 00:32:24,063
Oh.. No, not me.
It's not safe to speak you.

450
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:24,667
Right!

451
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:30,174
I'm talking about, Masters Ox and Croc!

452
00:32:30,778 --> 00:32:34,164
They are in Gongmen Jail,
at Black Dragon area.

453
00:32:34,165 --> 00:32:35,919
What?
They're still alive?!

454
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,883
They must be in that jail..

455
00:32:36,884 --> 00:32:40,758
Gathering intelligents hatching a plot to use
their awesomeness to defeat the weapon.

456
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:43,636
Okay, let's go!
Thank you, sheep.

457
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:45,874
Hey!
Stop that costume!

458
00:32:48,873 --> 00:32:50,516
Uhh.. Sorry!

459
00:32:50,517 --> 00:32:51,832
Take.. That!

460
00:32:52,462 --> 00:32:54,244
- Keep running!
- Faster!

461
00:33:21,803 --> 00:33:22,658
Now!

462
00:33:22,659 --> 00:33:23,659
Got you!

463
00:33:25,693 --> 00:33:26,145
Huh?

464
00:33:26,146 --> 00:33:27,548
Where did they go?

465
00:33:27,549 --> 00:33:28,391
Split up!

466
00:33:28,392 --> 00:33:29,553
Search every where!

467
00:33:29,554 --> 00:33:30,428
What about over there?

468
00:33:30,811 --> 00:33:33,017
Is 'there' a part of every where?

469
00:33:33,018 --> 00:33:34,424
I.. I guess.

470
00:33:34,469 --> 00:33:35,547
Then search there!

471
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,868
The most be close.

472
00:33:42,288 --> 00:33:44,762
I can feel a Kung-Fu chill,
riding up by my side!

473
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:46,610
Sorry, Po.
It's just me!

474
00:33:47,631 --> 00:33:48,303
Look!

475
00:33:48,679 --> 00:33:49,725
'Gongmen Jail'!

476
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:54,716
Oh.. It's cute.

477
00:33:56,052 --> 00:33:57,422
Cute? Huh?

478
00:34:06,923 --> 00:34:07,875
Nice work, Po.

479
00:34:09,876 --> 00:34:12,572
At the first sight of trouble,
I'll give you a signal.

480
00:34:12,573 --> 00:34:13,742
Gaga-Gagy!

481
00:34:14,015 --> 00:34:15,600
- You mean like Crane does?
- Yeah!

482
00:34:15,601 --> 00:34:18,713
Excuse me!
When have I ever, made that noise?

483
00:34:19,485 --> 00:34:21,779
Master Ox!
Master..

484
00:34:23,991 --> 00:34:25,530
Master Croc!

485
00:34:26,972 --> 00:34:29,101
Hey.. Master storming, Ox!

486
00:34:30,669 --> 00:34:33,301
I can't belive, I'm rescuing
actula legends of Kung-Fu.

487
00:34:33,209 --> 00:34:38,206
No, they wouldn't leave
a key around here.

488
00:34:40,106 --> 00:34:42,571
Oh, good.. You found it!
Come on you guys. Yeah!

489
00:34:43,309 --> 00:34:44,392
We're coming for you, Shen!

490
00:34:50,525 --> 00:34:51,725
Guys, are we going or not?

491
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,627
Do you wanna do this later? I mean,
you do wanna take back you city. Right?

492
00:34:55,743 --> 00:34:57,242
Of course, we do.

493
00:34:57,243 --> 00:35:00,808
But if we stand up against Shen,
he will turn the weapon on the city!

494
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:02,310
Listen to your self.

495
00:35:02,311 --> 00:35:04,898
You're protecting Gongmen city,
by not protecting Gongmen city?

496
00:35:04,899 --> 00:35:06,411
If we all fight together..

497
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:09,909
Then the weapon would kill, everyone.

498
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:10,880
Oh, would it?

499
00:35:11,262 --> 00:35:13,498
Then we use, a sneak attack.

500
00:35:13,683 --> 00:35:17,127
- We'll get inside, and then...
- And then you'll be stopped!

501
00:35:19,881 --> 00:35:21,868
By the unstoppable weapon.

502
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:22,513
No thing is unstoppable.

503
00:35:22,514 --> 00:35:25,988
Except for me. When I'm stopping you
from telling me something unstoppable.

504
00:35:37,152 --> 00:35:40,471
Master Ox,
I'm not let you stay in this cell!

505
00:35:40,368 --> 00:35:42,137
Then let's just see
how you get me out!

506
00:35:47,781 --> 00:35:49,618
You guys see that?
It's called beeing awesome!

507
00:35:49,913 --> 00:35:51,935
Come on! what ever
happen to be a hero?

508
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:54,550
The only hero in this town,
is the dead one.

509
00:35:59,508 --> 00:36:02,480
Like I said; You are not
getting me outta this cell!

510
00:36:05,629 --> 00:36:06,401
Yes!

511
00:36:08,287 --> 00:36:09,638
Alright. Let's go!

512
00:36:10,703 --> 00:36:11,945
I get the top bunk.

513
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:15,408
It's time to surrender, panda.

514
00:36:16,318 --> 00:36:17,738
Kung-Fu is dead!

515
00:36:18,315 --> 00:36:18,986
I..

516
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:25,710
You.. You.. Kung-Fu is a dea..aa.ad!

517
00:36:25,999 --> 00:36:27,363
Fine!

518
00:36:27,766 --> 00:36:31,167
You stay in your prison of fear!
With bars made of hopelessnest.

519
00:36:31,168 --> 00:36:34,294
And all you get is 3 square
meals a day of... Shame.

520
00:36:34,459 --> 00:36:36,347
With disparateful dessert.

521
00:36:36,348 --> 00:36:37,659
We'll take on Shen.

522
00:36:37,923 --> 00:36:40,401
And prove to all those
who hunger for justice!

523
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,732
And honor, 'The Kung-Fu still lives'.

524
00:36:43,733 --> 00:36:45,276
Yeah!

525
00:36:48,387 --> 00:36:49,442
Monkey!

526
00:36:50,478 --> 00:36:51,178
Gaga!

527
00:36:51,179 --> 00:36:52,582
You.. You're mine!

528
00:36:52,583 --> 00:36:54,336
I'll tell you what's gonna be yours..

529
00:36:54,711 --> 00:36:57,372
My fist and those guards deadly
punch, to your super-sole face!

530
00:36:58,855 --> 00:36:59,384
Uh-ouh!

531
00:37:00,225 --> 00:37:00,993
Get him!

532
00:37:02,084 --> 00:37:03,598
- Get me outta here!
- Yes, sir!

533
00:37:04,656 --> 00:37:05,718
- Stop him!
- Yeah!

534
00:37:16,598 --> 00:37:18,453
- Lose him!
- Yes, sir!

535
00:37:20,977 --> 00:37:22,171
Hang on!

536
00:37:32,666 --> 00:37:34,022
Watch out!

537
00:37:38,368 --> 00:37:39,403
Try this, fool!

538
00:37:39,761 --> 00:37:40,742
Sure, I did!

539
00:37:49,004 --> 00:37:50,556
Maybe something small.

540
00:37:51,454 --> 00:37:52,208
Oh, no!

541
00:37:58,101 --> 00:37:59,129
You better get off from me!

542
00:38:10,051 --> 00:38:11,587
- Higher!
- Higher!

543
00:38:12,893 --> 00:38:13,710
We lost them.

544
00:38:23,356 --> 00:38:23,878
Again!

545
00:38:26,143 --> 00:38:27,383
Crane, catch!

546
00:38:41,606 --> 00:38:42,732
Guys, guys, guys.. give me a shot.

547
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:45,078
Mantis, now!

548
00:38:59,485 --> 00:39:03,431
Is that all you got? Because I fell
it like a beetles filthy fight!

549
00:39:03,432 --> 00:39:05,497
This glad is about to put under thunder!

550
00:39:12,386 --> 00:39:15,560
Why there are.. so.. many.. stars?

551
00:39:31,604 --> 00:39:32,223
Come here!

552
00:39:32,484 --> 00:39:33,443
I like to squash..

553
00:39:35,036 --> 00:39:37,910
Yes!
Taste of the defeat.

554
00:39:38,535 --> 00:39:39,785
Let me tell you something..

555
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:43,202
Next time you miss with a panda,
you better bring a whole...

556
00:39:53,092 --> 00:39:56,186
Guess no body told you;
If you miss with a wolve..

557
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:57,759
You'll get the fangs.

558
00:39:58,343 --> 00:39:59,722
I hit you twice..

559
00:39:59,723 --> 00:40:01,951
what are you gonna do now?

560
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:06,857
We surrender!

561
00:40:10,306 --> 00:40:15,203
You could chain my body but you will
never chain my.. warrior spirit.

562
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:16,411
- They don't forget the little guy!
- Did you just called me..

563
00:40:16,412 --> 00:40:18,741
Po, what're you doing?

564
00:40:19,919 --> 00:40:21,422
Trust me, I gotta a... pla..ww!

565
00:40:22,121 --> 00:40:23,121
No way!

566
00:40:23,505 --> 00:40:25,595
Eight point akupressur cuffs!

567
00:40:25,596 --> 00:40:28,279
Just like the one that held Tailong, the
more you move the tier they get..

568
00:40:29,377 --> 00:40:31,042
These are the best cuffs.

569
00:40:34,061 --> 00:40:36,592
Greetings, panda.
At last we meet.

570
00:40:38,424 --> 00:40:39,808
No. No, no, no..

571
00:40:43,081 --> 00:40:44,840
We meet at last!

572
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:46,995
Yes!
That's it!

573
00:40:47,541 --> 00:40:49,009
Greetings, panda.
We meet at..

574
00:40:51,524 --> 00:40:53,532
You are afraid for a reason.

575
00:40:53,533 --> 00:40:54,481
I'm not afraid.

576
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:58,014
He's coming to me in chains.

577
00:40:58,197 --> 00:40:59,972
Have anyone should be afraid?

578
00:41:00,097 --> 00:41:01,592
You!

579
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:06,241
Don't you, little sick goat!

580
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:21,449
I hope this turns out
better than you planned to..

581
00:41:21,582 --> 00:41:25,060
Cup rice in your stomache by eating
raw and dreanking boiling watter.

582
00:41:25,061 --> 00:41:26,804
This plan's nothing like that plan.

583
00:41:27,604 --> 00:41:29,279
This is one's gonna work!

584
00:41:42,015 --> 00:41:43,468
Keep moving.

585
00:41:49,748 --> 00:41:52,146
Ah... My old enemy!

586
00:41:56,844 --> 00:41:58,520
Stairs!

587
00:42:27,206 --> 00:42:29,646
Thanks for carying me.
This is the last of my claim..

588
00:42:29,836 --> 00:42:32,319
Okay.
I threw up a little bit on the third floor,

589
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,533
Someone might wanna clean that up.

590
00:42:34,717 --> 00:42:36,911
There's some sort of evil janitor, or something.

591
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:40,310
Greetings, panda.
We meet at..

592
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:41,619
Hi. How you doing?

593
00:42:43,091 --> 00:42:44,503
Hey...

594
00:42:44,844 --> 00:42:48,091
You've grown up
bigger than I thought.

595
00:42:48,398 --> 00:42:50,933
Hey, okay.
I have enough food.

596
00:42:50,934 --> 00:42:52,222
Strong.

597
00:42:52,729 --> 00:42:53,729
Healthy.

598
00:42:54,014 --> 00:42:56,812
Look, I don't know who you are.
But please stand a side, sir.

599
00:42:56,813 --> 00:42:57,615
That's a lady!

600
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:58,616
Oh.. Sorry!

601
00:42:59,102 --> 00:43:01,492
The beard through me,
it's kind of miss leading.

602
00:43:02,406 --> 00:43:03,524
False every time.

603
00:43:03,525 --> 00:43:04,776
Enough of this!

604
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:07,027
Bring the prisoners to me.

605
00:43:07,396 --> 00:43:11,004
Sorry ma'am. Get ready guys,
keep your eyes held for the..

606
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:11,753
Weapon!

607
00:43:18,991 --> 00:43:21,699
We did it! I just Kung-Fued it.
Did you guys see that?

608
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:22,281
I was all like..

609
00:43:22,282 --> 00:43:23,282
Waao!

610
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:34,927
How do you actually believe,
this is the warrior destined to defeat me?

611
00:43:35,169 --> 00:43:36,345
I do not!

612
00:43:36,346 --> 00:43:38,206
I know he is.

613
00:43:39,634 --> 00:43:40,569
Look at him!

614
00:43:40,958 --> 00:43:45,143
A life time to plan his revenge,
then he comes to be on his knee.

615
00:43:45,144 --> 00:43:47,900
A life time.. Wo-wo-wo!
I did not have a life time.

616
00:43:47,901 --> 00:43:50,423
We only heard about
master Rhino a few days ago,

617
00:43:50,588 --> 00:43:52,212
And we've came to revenge him!

618
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:54,976
You've come to revange,
nothing else?

619
00:43:54,977 --> 00:43:58,612
Well, Yeah. All the pots and pants
that you stole, I want those back.

620
00:43:58,766 --> 00:44:00,137
Nothing else?

621
00:44:00,155 --> 00:44:02,703
You probaly did some evil step, for long away.

622
00:44:02,704 --> 00:44:04,252
I don't know..
What else did you do?

623
00:44:04,253 --> 00:44:06,237
- You don't know?!
- Know what?

624
00:44:06,821 --> 00:44:08,106
What's so funny?

625
00:44:08,107 --> 00:44:09,064
Very thing!

626
00:44:09,282 --> 00:44:11,175
Did you clearly do not know?

627
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:12,995
Okay, enough for these readls!

628
00:44:12,996 --> 00:44:14,859
Would you guys spell the bins?

629
00:44:15,248 --> 00:44:18,444
First we know, we came in and
the weapon is tiny.. surprise, it's big!

630
00:44:18,609 --> 00:44:21,754
And then, lady over here,
I think it's a guy, he's gotta be..

631
00:44:23,271 --> 00:44:25,427
The only reason you're still alive,

632
00:44:25,428 --> 00:44:30,688
Is that, I found your stupidity, mildly amusing.

633
00:44:30,689 --> 00:44:34,185
Well, thank you. But I found your
evilness extremely annoying!

634
00:44:34,186 --> 00:44:36,400
Who do you think you are, panda?

635
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:38,610
Who do you think am I, peacock?

636
00:44:47,596 --> 00:44:49,770
Why are we laughing?

637
00:44:50,965 --> 00:44:51,635
Take him.

638
00:45:03,663 --> 00:45:04,542
Fire!

639
00:45:09,218 --> 00:45:11,939
Can you light that... thing?

640
00:45:18,002 --> 00:45:19,929
Here the bug!

641
00:45:29,054 --> 00:45:30,033
Get the weapon!

642
00:45:32,439 --> 00:45:33,562
Tigress!

643
00:46:07,787 --> 00:46:12,037
- You.. You were there.
- Yes.. Yes, I was!

644
00:46:19,912 --> 00:46:21,432
You just let Shen, get away.

645
00:46:21,433 --> 00:46:23,054
We destroyed the weapon!

646
00:46:27,758 --> 00:46:28,739
Fire!

647
00:46:32,277 --> 00:46:33,988
Uh.. No!
He's got a way more.

648
00:46:34,951 --> 00:46:35,840
Wow!

649
00:46:40,038 --> 00:46:40,966
My wings!

650
00:46:41,237 --> 00:46:42,875
- Help, Po!
- Coming!

651
00:46:43,823 --> 00:46:44,704
Watch out!

652
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:46,205
Po!

653
00:46:50,035 --> 00:46:52,606
- Help me up!
- No. Get him down.

654
00:46:52,884 --> 00:46:53,743
Use the ropes.

655
00:47:02,943 --> 00:47:05,455
Run, run.. Little panda!

656
00:47:16,256 --> 00:47:18,680
Help, come on!
We need you to focus.

657
00:47:18,812 --> 00:47:19,814
I've got it, I've got it!

658
00:47:19,815 --> 00:47:20,946
Bring 'em down!

659
00:47:24,776 --> 00:47:26,784
- We trapped!
- This way.

660
00:47:31,602 --> 00:47:32,902
Good bye!

661
00:47:35,761 --> 00:47:36,680
Fire!

662
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:39,583
Get back!

663
00:47:48,288 --> 00:47:49,987
Lonely way out, is up.

664
00:47:50,959 --> 00:47:51,504
What?

665
00:48:03,406 --> 00:48:03,934
Follow me.

666
00:48:04,741 --> 00:48:05,425
Come on!

667
00:48:06,171 --> 00:48:07,608
Where are they going?

668
00:48:08,172 --> 00:48:08,872
To the top!

669
00:48:08,873 --> 00:48:10,357
Come on, peacock!

670
00:48:18,015 --> 00:48:19,225
You'll be down!

671
00:48:38,223 --> 00:48:39,473
You idiot!

672
00:48:40,661 --> 00:48:41,383
My nose!

673
00:48:41,942 --> 00:48:43,790
Call in the wolves.. All of them!

674
00:48:43,791 --> 00:48:45,911
I want them ready to move!

675
00:48:46,328 --> 00:48:50,177
The year of the peacock,
begins now!

676
00:48:50,325 --> 00:48:51,031
Right now?

677
00:48:51,515 --> 00:48:53,218
'Cause it's the middle of the year.

678
00:48:53,219 --> 00:48:55,882
So you don't only get, like a
half of the year of peacock.

679
00:48:57,673 --> 00:49:01,077
And this is the year,
of course, of the peacock.

680
00:49:01,319 --> 00:49:02,241
Happy new year, sir!

681
00:49:06,268 --> 00:49:08,358
Get the wolves ready!

682
00:49:08,629 --> 00:49:10,634
We're loading the ships, now.

683
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:12,010
Now!

684
00:49:12,717 --> 00:49:14,207
Now, now, now...!

685
00:49:33,466 --> 00:49:34,262
This way.

686
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:40,647
Go!

687
00:49:46,682 --> 00:49:47,428
Oh.. You!

688
00:49:47,966 --> 00:49:48,840
What did you do?

689
00:49:49,091 --> 00:49:52,092
It's chaos up there.
What happened to stopping Shen?

690
00:49:53,278 --> 00:49:54,517
Yeah..

691
00:49:56,186 --> 00:49:58,550
Guys, come on!
Give me a little credit.

692
00:49:58,815 --> 00:50:00,259
I meant for him, to get away.

693
00:50:00,905 --> 00:50:03,229
'Cause.. It's a trick.
There's a lot!

694
00:50:04,014 --> 00:50:08,468
I was thinking, of..
figure out his plan.. more.

695
00:50:09,770 --> 00:50:11,860
That makes, no sense.

696
00:50:12,059 --> 00:50:13,839
What you mean?
What you mean? It sure does.

697
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:15,907
Po, the truth!
You had Shen.

698
00:50:15,908 --> 00:50:16,834
What happened?

699
00:50:17,461 --> 00:50:19,470
What're you talking about? What're you..
I don't know, what are you talking about?

700
00:50:19,471 --> 00:50:21,780
Uh.. Yeah!
Ahh.. You got me of course.

701
00:50:22,804 --> 00:50:23,666
The truth!

702
00:50:27,228 --> 00:50:28,122
Fine!

703
00:50:29,552 --> 00:50:31,266
They'll keep you far from danger.

704
00:50:31,267 --> 00:50:32,505
Realist far!

705
00:50:32,888 --> 00:50:33,816
What?

706
00:50:34,249 --> 00:50:35,239
You're staying here.

707
00:50:36,012 --> 00:50:37,333
Wa.. Wait!

708
00:50:38,324 --> 00:50:39,229
I have to go back..

709
00:50:44,222 --> 00:50:46,217
You are staying here.

710
00:50:46,947 --> 00:50:48,705
I'm going.
And you can't stop me!

711
00:50:51,849 --> 00:50:54,215
Okay, I wasn't ready that time.

712
00:50:54,511 --> 00:50:55,777
Guys, don't!

713
00:50:56,241 --> 00:50:57,031
Ready!

714
00:50:58,374 --> 00:50:58,881
Look!

715
00:51:11,993 --> 00:51:13,146
Stay down!

716
00:51:14,301 --> 00:51:16,020
I have to get to him.

717
00:51:16,528 --> 00:51:17,646
Then, tell me why.

718
00:51:19,776 --> 00:51:22,228
He was there.
Okay?

719
00:51:22,809 --> 00:51:25,558
The peacock was there,
the last time I saw my parents.

720
00:51:26,057 --> 00:51:27,485
He knows what happened.

721
00:51:28,076 --> 00:51:29,288
Where I came from.

722
00:51:30,210 --> 00:51:31,161
Who I am.

723
00:51:35,927 --> 00:51:37,064
Look, I'm going.

724
00:51:38,784 --> 00:51:39,733
I have to know.

725
00:51:40,948 --> 00:51:43,117
The hard core can't understand.

726
00:51:43,459 --> 00:51:44,662
Tigress.. No!

727
00:51:49,105 --> 00:51:51,129
The hard core do understand.

728
00:51:52,962 --> 00:51:55,146
But I can't watch my friend,
be killed.

729
00:51:56,891 --> 00:51:57,872
We're going.

730
00:51:57,873 --> 00:52:01,339
Hey!
Maybe you can't watch me be killed.

731
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:02,396
Stop it one wing.

732
00:52:02,674 --> 00:52:04,252
And.. She's back!

733
00:52:06,935 --> 00:52:08,205
Don't worry, kid.

734
00:52:08,585 --> 00:52:09,807
We better all here.

735
00:52:19,532 --> 00:52:21,168
You were wrong, Soothsayer.

736
00:52:21,806 --> 00:52:23,602
We sail to victory tonight.

737
00:52:24,414 --> 00:52:26,981
Your magic panda is clearly a fool.

738
00:52:26,982 --> 00:52:29,977
I'm certain it's the panda who is a fool

739
00:52:30,155 --> 00:52:33,073
You just destroyed your ancestor home Shen.

740
00:52:33,074 --> 00:52:34,469
I'll trivial the sacrifice,

741
00:52:35,472 --> 00:52:38,106
When all of the China
is my reward!

742
00:52:38,255 --> 00:52:41,039
Then will you finaly be satisfied..

743
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:45,126
While the subduction of the whole
world, finaly make you feel better.

744
00:52:45,397 --> 00:52:46,810
Hmm.. This is not.

745
00:52:46,946 --> 00:52:49,868
I'll mightily sacrifice
them in the dungeon.

746
00:52:52,791 --> 00:52:55,408
The coup you choose to fill,
has no bottom.

747
00:52:55,612 --> 00:52:58,412
It's time to stop this madness!

748
00:52:59,767 --> 00:53:01,641
Why on Earth would I do that?

749
00:53:01,642 --> 00:53:04,097
So your parents
can rest in peace.

750
00:53:04,673 --> 00:53:06,019
My parents..

751
00:53:06,907 --> 00:53:07,784
Hated me!

752
00:53:09,015 --> 00:53:10,396
Do you understand?

753
00:53:11,662 --> 00:53:13,388
They wronged to me.

754
00:53:14,162 --> 00:53:15,035
And then..

755
00:53:15,786 --> 00:53:17,405
I.. Will make it right.

756
00:53:17,406 --> 00:53:18,403
They loved you..

757
00:53:18,843 --> 00:53:23,470
They loved you so much, that
having to send you away kill them.

758
00:53:25,802 --> 00:53:28,548
The dead exist in the past.

759
00:53:29,533 --> 00:53:31,929
And I must attend to the future.

760
00:53:36,858 --> 00:53:38,605
Set the Soothsayer free.

761
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:40,927
She is not a use to me.

762
00:53:41,147 --> 00:53:42,265
Good bye, Shen.

763
00:53:42,902 --> 00:53:44,405
I wish you happiness.

764
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:47,631
Happiness, most be taken.

765
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,242
And I will take mine.

766
00:54:13,438 --> 00:54:14,497
Hurry it up!

767
00:54:17,203 --> 00:54:19,345
If all those weapons
leave the building..

768
00:54:19,653 --> 00:54:20,639
China will fall.

769
00:54:20,828 --> 00:54:22,679
- We'll bring down the building.
- I got it!

770
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:24,572
How about this?

771
00:54:26,539 --> 00:54:28,365
That's will work!

772
00:54:28,812 --> 00:54:31,031
- Alright, let's go.
- I can't feel my face!

773
00:54:46,782 --> 00:54:49,435
Damn what you call Peacock!

774
00:54:49,725 --> 00:54:50,564
Hey!

775
00:54:51,459 --> 00:54:52,100
Hey.

776
00:54:52,641 --> 00:54:53,826
You guys keep it cool, cool, cool.

777
00:54:54,142 --> 00:54:54,910
You!

778
00:54:54,911 --> 00:54:56,066
Where you going?

779
00:54:58,603 --> 00:54:59,647
On your feet!

780
00:54:59,831 --> 00:55:02,440
And whipe those stupid
careens on your faces!

781
00:55:16,156 --> 00:55:18,245
Move, you dogs!
Faster, faster!

782
00:55:18,861 --> 00:55:19,910
Load the boat.

783
00:55:29,753 --> 00:55:31,410
Greetings, panda!

784
00:55:35,437 --> 00:55:36,760
Tell me what happened that night?

785
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:37,958
What night?

786
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:39,391
That night!

787
00:55:40,007 --> 00:55:41,607
Ahh.. That night.

788
00:55:41,608 --> 00:55:42,469
Yes.

789
00:55:42,573 --> 00:55:44,047
Yes, I was there.

790
00:55:44,048 --> 00:55:46,597
Yes, I watched your
parents abandoned you.

791
00:55:46,598 --> 00:55:47,946
It's a terrible thing.

792
00:55:48,206 --> 00:55:50,782
I believe, it was something like.. This!

793
00:56:02,854 --> 00:56:05,183
Hope you like it.
'Cause you can't return it!

794
00:56:07,187 --> 00:56:09,154
Po? What's he doing there?

795
00:56:10,015 --> 00:56:11,637
Return it! Return it!

796
00:56:23,782 --> 00:56:26,025
Now you willing to die,
to find the truth.

797
00:56:26,404 --> 00:56:27,417
You bet I am.

798
00:56:27,708 --> 00:56:29,661
Of all I..
For or for not to.

799
00:56:52,497 --> 00:56:53,741
We got them, Go!

800
00:57:16,035 --> 00:57:16,857
Looking for me?

801
00:57:24,072 --> 00:57:25,854
I said that too soon,
Didn't I?

802
00:57:34,609 --> 00:57:35,580
Po!

803
00:57:40,691 --> 00:57:42,313
Po, get away from him!

804
00:57:46,899 --> 00:57:48,380
No more running, Shen.

805
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:49,355
So it seems.

806
00:57:50,314 --> 00:57:51,008
Now..

807
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:51,943
Answers!

808
00:57:52,113 --> 00:57:53,968
Oh, You want to know so badly.

809
00:57:55,518 --> 00:57:57,146
You think knowing it will heal you?

810
00:57:57,499 --> 00:57:58,293
Huh?

811
00:57:59,262 --> 00:58:01,998
Fill some crater in your soul.

812
00:58:02,968 --> 00:58:04,466
Well, here's you answer..

813
00:58:05,115 --> 00:58:07,892
Your parents, didn't love you.

814
00:58:09,099 --> 00:58:13,458
But here.. Let me heal you.

815
00:58:20,432 --> 00:58:21,137
No!

816
00:59:36,266 --> 00:59:39,102
Yeah, like you can make me drink that...

817
00:59:43,132 --> 00:59:47,309
If I wanted you dead,
I would have left you in that river.

818
00:59:48,239 --> 00:59:49,178
Why do you save me?

819
00:59:49,179 --> 00:59:51,975
So you can full-fill your destiny.

820
00:59:51,976 --> 00:59:53,020
What're you talking about?

821
00:59:54,131 --> 00:59:55,017
Where am I?

822
00:59:57,284 --> 00:59:58,224
What's this place?

823
00:59:58,944 --> 01:00:02,643
I'm surprised you remember so little.

824
01:00:02,644 --> 01:00:06,509
But.. You were so little,
when it happened.

825
01:00:11,872 --> 01:00:14,140
Perhaps you do remember.

826
01:00:14,349 --> 01:00:16,657
Now what?
It's just a stupid nightmare.

827
01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:17,807
Nightmare..

828
01:00:17,808 --> 01:00:18,995
Or memory?

829
01:00:32,698 --> 01:00:33,997
<i>Stop hiding!</i>

830
01:00:49,473 --> 01:00:51,829
This was a striving vilage.

831
01:00:52,513 --> 01:00:55,623
Young Shen was in line
to rule Gongmen city.

832
01:00:56,249 --> 01:00:58,121
But he wanted more.

833
01:00:58,595 --> 01:01:02,107
I foretold that someone
will stand in his way.

834
01:01:02,305 --> 01:01:03,656
A panda!

835
01:01:04,312 --> 01:01:07,707
But I never could've foretold,
what came next.

836
01:01:20,950 --> 01:01:22,285
<i>Kill them all!</i>

837
01:01:29,625 --> 01:01:31,366
<i>Pick our son.
And run away!</i>

838
01:01:31,733 --> 01:01:32,647
<i>Go!</i>

839
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:47,695
Stop fighting!

840
01:01:48,292 --> 01:01:50,037
Let it flow.

841
01:03:53,848 --> 01:03:57,038
Your story may not have
such a happy beginning.

842
01:03:58,003 --> 01:04:00,150
But, that doesn't make you who you are.

843
01:04:01,019 --> 01:04:03,353
It's the rest of your story.

844
01:04:04,808 --> 01:04:06,504
Who you choose to be.

845
01:04:38,347 --> 01:04:39,151
So..

846
01:04:40,220 --> 01:04:41,973
Who are you, panda?

847
01:04:49,428 --> 01:04:51,705
I am Po.

848
01:04:53,448 --> 01:04:55,323
And I'm gonna need a hat.

849
01:05:08,725 --> 01:05:10,456
But now it's a time only for joy.

850
01:05:11,188 --> 01:05:14,675
You are going to be part
of something, beautiful!

851
01:05:17,576 --> 01:05:19,048
Once we reach the harbor

852
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:21,200
In front of whole the world..

853
01:05:21,603 --> 01:05:25,307
You and your precious Kung-Fu, will die!

854
01:05:27,903 --> 01:05:32,585
And China, will nod and bowed before me.

855
01:05:32,922 --> 01:05:33,969
Set sail!

856
01:06:07,849 --> 01:06:10,196
Honesty guys, I never
thought I'll die like this.

857
01:06:10,989 --> 01:06:13,213
I was thought I'll meet a nice girl,
and settle down, and..

858
01:06:13,902 --> 01:06:15,146
And she'll it my head.

859
01:06:16,031 --> 01:06:16,916
So sad!

860
01:06:17,052 --> 01:06:20,746
We can not give up hope.
Po would warn us to remain strong.

861
01:06:20,747 --> 01:06:21,747
Hard core. Right?
Tigress?

862
01:06:30,869 --> 01:06:32,753
Lord Shen,
what about the bridge?

863
01:06:32,917 --> 01:06:35,222
Nothing stands on my way.

864
01:06:35,903 --> 01:06:36,801
Fire!

865
01:06:46,193 --> 01:06:47,565
You coward!

866
01:06:58,138 --> 01:06:58,913
Po?

867
01:07:01,548 --> 01:07:02,802
- Po?
- Po?

868
01:07:04,707 --> 01:07:09,863
How many times, do I have to
kill this same stinky panda?

869
01:07:19,415 --> 01:07:20,126
Shen!

870
01:07:20,787 --> 01:07:24,420
A panda, stands between you and your <i>destiny</i>!</i>

871
01:07:25,403 --> 01:07:26,937
What?

872
01:07:26,938 --> 01:07:30,416
Prepare yourself for a hot <i>server of justice</i>.

873
01:07:30,758 --> 01:07:32,752
<i>That will bring Shen to the end!</i>

874
01:07:32,925 --> 01:07:33,653
What?

875
01:07:33,991 --> 01:07:35,941
And now, free the Five!

876
01:07:36,125 --> 01:07:37,507
Disk of destruction!

877
01:07:49,233 --> 01:07:50,457
Okay..

878
01:07:51,181 --> 01:07:52,470
Take him!

879
01:08:03,447 --> 01:08:04,540
Ready?

880
01:08:20,495 --> 01:08:22,654
This way and that way.
That way and this way.

881
01:08:22,779 --> 01:08:23,418
Yes.

882
01:08:26,114 --> 01:08:26,891
You can't follow me!

883
01:08:28,364 --> 01:08:29,439
Just, get him!

884
01:08:34,817 --> 01:08:36,003
Yeah.. Ha..
Here we go.

885
01:08:43,778 --> 01:08:45,551
- No, no, no.. Don't shoot!
- Don't shoot!

886
01:08:46,609 --> 01:08:48,529
- Don't shoot!
- Don't shoot!

887
01:08:49,721 --> 01:08:50,347
Don't shoot!

888
01:08:51,901 --> 01:08:53,105
Don't...

889
01:08:54,101 --> 01:08:55,751
- Yeah!
- Don't shoot!

890
01:08:56,143 --> 01:08:56,868
Crossfire!

891
01:08:57,026 --> 01:08:57,740
Attack!

892
01:09:03,991 --> 01:09:04,832
Capture of freedom!

893
01:09:05,473 --> 01:09:06,273
Monkey!

894
01:09:11,761 --> 01:09:13,450
Impressive, Dragon Warrior.

895
01:09:13,586 --> 01:09:14,271
What's your plan?

896
01:09:14,272 --> 01:09:15,629
Step 1: Free the Five.

897
01:09:15,630 --> 01:09:16,630
What's step 2?

898
01:09:16,631 --> 01:09:17,631
Honestly, I didn't think
I'd make it this far.

899
01:09:17,632 --> 01:09:19,052
Po!

900
01:09:19,976 --> 01:09:21,494
Stop Shen,
before he gets to the harbour.

901
01:09:26,866 --> 01:09:27,934
Hoo-hoo!
Nice!

902
01:09:30,799 --> 01:09:32,113
Viper, Puppet of Death.

903
01:09:32,761 --> 01:09:33,733
Tigress!

904
01:09:42,689 --> 01:09:43,481
Master Ox!

905
01:09:45,219 --> 01:09:45,769
And Croc!

906
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:47,399
Vengeance is served.

907
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:49,044
- Why did you..?
- Your friend there..

908
01:09:49,045 --> 01:09:50,614
Is very persuasive.

909
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:58,808
Mr. Shifu!

910
01:10:01,471 --> 01:10:03,826
Quickly! Use their
boats to block the way.

911
01:10:14,620 --> 01:10:15,156
Crane!

912
01:10:16,624 --> 01:10:18,044
Wings of Justice!

913
01:10:18,734 --> 01:10:19,954
Ca-ca!

914
01:10:28,491 --> 01:10:28,915
What?

915
01:10:38,943 --> 01:10:42,939
<i>I love you guys!</i>

916
01:10:52,203 --> 01:10:53,801
Why aren't we firing?

917
01:10:53,802 --> 01:10:55,357
They're taken out our guns, sir.

918
01:10:55,724 --> 01:10:56,499
They're getting close!

919
01:10:58,649 --> 01:11:01,976
Fire, fire at what are in there all!

920
01:11:02,248 --> 01:11:04,148
But sir, they're your own.

921
01:11:04,432 --> 01:11:07,501
I said; Fire and fire!

922
01:11:10,401 --> 01:11:10,985
No!

923
01:11:18,743 --> 01:11:19,448
Po!

924
01:11:55,448 --> 01:11:56,434
Tigress?

925
01:12:46,595 --> 01:12:47,706
As you wish..

926
01:12:48,494 --> 01:12:49,401
Let's finish this!

927
01:13:13,662 --> 01:13:14,459
Fire!

928
01:13:20,012 --> 01:13:20,815
Inner peace.

929
01:13:20,816 --> 01:13:23,401
<i>Inner peace.</i>

930
01:13:49,025 --> 01:13:49,779
Again!

931
01:13:57,400 --> 01:13:58,339
Yeah!
Hoo!

932
01:13:59,804 --> 01:14:00,685
Kill him!

933
01:14:00,853 --> 01:14:02,671
Somebody, kill him!

934
01:14:25,023 --> 01:14:26,815
What?
No!

935
01:14:33,678 --> 01:14:34,932
Keep firing.

936
01:14:35,401 --> 01:14:36,926
Keep firing!

937
01:15:29,010 --> 01:15:30,714
How did you..

938
01:15:31,685 --> 01:15:33,497
How did you do it?

939
01:15:37,614 --> 01:15:39,003
You know, you just
keep your elbows up,

940
01:15:39,004 --> 01:15:43,159
- And keep your shoulder loose.
- Not that! How did you found peace?

941
01:15:43,786 --> 01:15:45,500
I took away your parents!

942
01:15:45,998 --> 01:15:49,497
Everything!
I scared you for life.

943
01:15:50,391 --> 01:15:53,572
See? That's the thing, Shen..
Scars heal.

944
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:55,792
No, they don't.

945
01:15:56,284 --> 01:15:58,048
Wounds heal.

946
01:15:58,639 --> 01:15:59,726
Oh, yeah!
What does scar do?

947
01:15:59,727 --> 01:16:00,886
They fade, I guess?

948
01:16:00,887 --> 01:16:02,884
I don't care what scars do.

949
01:16:03,529 --> 01:16:04,758
You should, Shen.

950
01:16:05,239 --> 01:16:08,967
You've gotta let go that stuff in the past.
'Cause, it's just doesn't matter!

951
01:16:09,806 --> 01:16:13,731
The only thing that matters,
is what you choose to be now.

952
01:16:14,106 --> 01:16:15,030
You're right.

953
01:16:15,523 --> 01:16:16,879
Then, I choose..

954
01:16:17,292 --> 01:16:18,017
This!

955
01:17:10,691 --> 01:17:12,838
That.. Was pretty hard core.

956
01:17:23,218 --> 01:17:24,058
Po! You're here!

957
01:17:24,428 --> 01:17:25,695
Don't ever do that again, please?

958
01:17:26,669 --> 01:17:29,871
It seems you have found,
Inner Peace.

959
01:17:30,901 --> 01:17:32,099
That's such a young age!

960
01:17:33,223 --> 01:17:35,095
Well, I had a pretty good teacher.

961
01:17:55,694 --> 01:17:57,223
What do you mean, he's not here?

962
01:17:57,856 --> 01:17:59,569
It's my son's birthday!

963
01:17:59,945 --> 01:18:02,270
All he wanted, was to meet
the Dragon Warrior!

964
01:18:02,580 --> 01:18:05,046
How about some tofu
birthday cake, instead. Huh?

965
01:18:05,478 --> 01:18:07,421
You know?
I think we'll just try again, another time.

966
01:18:08,108 --> 01:18:09,500
When do you think he will be back?

967
01:18:12,490 --> 01:18:15,048
I don't know!
Okay? I don't know!

968
01:18:15,626 --> 01:18:16,362
Maybe, never!

969
01:18:17,161 --> 01:18:18,452
I'm worried. Okay?

970
01:18:18,573 --> 01:18:19,764
But, that's my job.

971
01:18:19,765 --> 01:18:22,484
I'm his dad! I mean..
I was his dad.

972
01:18:22,773 --> 01:18:25,006
Why did he had to go
and save Chaina?

973
01:18:25,457 --> 01:18:27,671
I know why..
But why?

974
01:18:27,852 --> 01:18:30,297
This is one little panda!

975
01:18:45,777 --> 01:18:47,737
So, how did it go?

976
01:18:48,223 --> 01:18:49,056
Did you saved China?

977
01:18:50,555 --> 01:18:51,135
Yep.

978
01:18:52,922 --> 01:18:54,263
Well.. I knew you could.

979
01:18:54,532 --> 01:18:57,845
That's why I have new signs made.
My son saved China.

980
01:18:57,846 --> 01:19:00,769
You two can save, by one
dumpling with one free!

981
01:19:01,528 --> 01:19:03,093
Hey.. That's a pretty good deal!

982
01:19:03,094 --> 01:19:04,350
Would you like to try one?

983
01:19:04,642 --> 01:19:05,390
Maybe later.

984
01:19:08,602 --> 01:19:09,803
There's something,
I should tell you.

985
01:19:13,682 --> 01:19:14,344
While I was gone..

986
01:19:15,724 --> 01:19:17,635
I found the village where I was born.

987
01:19:19,329 --> 01:19:22,438
I found out, how I ended
up, in that radish basket.

988
01:19:23,301 --> 01:19:24,093
You did?

989
01:19:25,374 --> 01:19:26,456
I know who I am.

990
01:19:27,813 --> 01:19:29,276
You do?

991
01:19:31,550 --> 01:19:32,508
I'm your son!

992
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:35,230
Oh..

993
01:19:38,881 --> 01:19:40,360
I love you, dad.

994
01:19:41,844 --> 01:19:43,463
I love you too, son!

995
01:19:47,606 --> 01:19:49,726
Delicious fat radishes.

996
01:19:50,096 --> 01:19:52,383
You probably hungry.
Let me cook something for you.

997
01:19:52,505 --> 01:19:53,835
What're you talking about?
I'll cook.

998
01:19:54,054 --> 01:19:55,324
No, no.
I'll cook.

999
01:19:55,325 --> 01:19:55,765
Dad?!

1000
01:19:55,917 --> 01:19:57,767
It's the least I can do.
You saved China!

1001
01:19:58,141 --> 01:20:00,820
No.. It's the least I can do.
You raised me!

1002
01:20:00,821 --> 01:20:01,451
- Po?
- Dad?

1003
00:20:01,452 --> 00:20:02,177
Po!

1004
01:20:02,178 --> 01:20:03,168
Okay!

1005
01:20:03,169 --> 01:20:04,645
Let's both cook.

1006
01:20:05,471 --> 01:20:06,787
- Together.
- Together.

1007
01:20:07,988 --> 01:20:08,768
No. I'll cook!

1008
01:20:15,096 --> 01:20:25,320

My son is alive!
