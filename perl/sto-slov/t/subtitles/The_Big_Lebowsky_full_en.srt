1
00:00:16,917 --> 00:00:19,397
A way out west
there was this fella,

2
00:00:19,397 --> 00:00:21,796
fella I want
to tell you about,

3
00:00:21,796 --> 00:00:25,395
fella by the name
of Jeff Lebowski,

4
00:00:25,475 --> 00:00:27,395
at least that
was the handle

5
00:00:27,434 --> 00:00:29,394
That his loving parents
gave him.

6
00:00:29,394 --> 00:00:32,393
But he never had
much use for it himself.

7
00:00:32,513 --> 00:00:36,472
This Lebowski,
he called himself The Dude.

8
00:00:36,552 --> 00:00:40,431
Now Dude, that's a name
no one would self-apply

9
00:00:40,471 --> 00:00:42,431
where I come from.

10
00:00:42,511 --> 00:00:44,870
But then, there was
a lot about The Dude

11
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,909
that didn't make a whole
lot of sense to me,

12
00:00:47,989 --> 00:00:50,828
and a lot about
where he lived, likewise.

13
00:00:52,828 --> 00:00:54,427
But then again,

14
00:00:54,467 --> 00:00:58,506
maybe that's why I found the
place so dern interesting.

15
00:01:02,425 --> 00:01:06,944
They call Los Angeles
The City of Angels.

16
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:09,943
I didn't find it
to be that exactly.

17
00:01:09,983 --> 00:01:13,902
But I'll allow there
are some nice folks there.

18
00:01:13,982 --> 00:01:16,822
'Course I can't
say I seen London,

19
00:01:16,862 --> 00:01:18,741
And I never
been to France,

20
00:01:18,861 --> 00:01:21,820
And I ain't never seen no
queen in her damned undies

21
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,940
as the fella says.

22
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,859
But I'll tell you what,

23
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:27,819
after seeing Los Angeles

24
00:01:27,859 --> 00:01:31,418
And this a-here story
I'm about to unfold,

25
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:34,417
Well, I guess
I seen somethin'

26
00:01:34,497 --> 00:01:35,857
every bit as stupefyin'

27
00:01:35,937 --> 00:01:38,416
as you'd see in any
of those other places,

28
00:01:38,416 --> 00:01:40,935
and in English, too.

29
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:43,934
So I can die
with a smile on my face

30
00:01:43,934 --> 00:01:47,494
without feeling like
the good Lord gypped me.

31
00:01:47,494 --> 00:01:49,933
Now this here story
I'm about to unfold

32
00:01:50,013 --> 00:01:53,012
took place back
in the early nineties,

33
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:55,451
just about the time of
our conflict with Saddam

34
00:01:55,571 --> 00:01:57,491
and the Iraqis.

35
00:01:57,491 --> 00:02:01,370
I only mention it 'cause
sometimes there's a man,

36
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:03,449
I won't say a hero,

37
00:02:03,449 --> 00:02:05,529
'Cause what's a hero?

38
00:02:05,529 --> 00:02:07,968
But sometimes
there's a man,

39
00:02:08,048 --> 00:02:11,087
and I'm talking
about The Dude here,

40
00:02:11,087 --> 00:02:13,927
sometimes there's a man,

41
00:02:15,366 --> 00:02:18,405
he's the man
for his time and place.

42
00:02:18,485 --> 00:02:21,525
He fits right in there,

43
00:02:21,605 --> 00:02:23,484
and that's The Dude,

44
00:02:23,564 --> 00:02:25,484
in Los Angeles.

45
00:02:25,484 --> 00:02:29,043
And even if
he's a lazy man,

46
00:02:29,123 --> 00:02:31,522
and The Dude was
most certainly that,

47
00:02:31,642 --> 00:02:35,041
quite possibly the laziest
in Los Angeles county,

48
00:02:35,081 --> 00:02:37,041
which would place him
high in the running

49
00:02:37,121 --> 00:02:40,120
for laziest worldwide.

50
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,999
But sometimes
there's a man,

51
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:46,478
sometimes...
There's a man.

52
00:02:46,558 --> 00:02:50,997
Wow, lost my train
of thought here.

53
00:02:54,036 --> 00:02:56,475
I done introduced
him enough.

54
00:02:56,515 --> 00:02:58,035
All for
a collective action.

55
00:02:58,075 --> 00:03:00,035
This will not stand.

56
00:03:00,115 --> 00:03:01,554
This will not stand,

57
00:03:01,594 --> 00:03:04,153
this aggression
against Kuwait.

58
00:03:04,193 --> 00:03:10,072
# Here on the range
I belong #

59
00:03:10,112 --> 00:03:15,590
# Drifting along
with the tumbling #

60
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:22,669
# Tumbleweed #

61
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:36,025
Where's the money,
Lebowski?

62
00:03:36,065 --> 00:03:38,424
I want that money,
Lebowski.

63
00:03:38,464 --> 00:03:41,104
Bunny says you're
good for it.

64
00:03:41,104 --> 00:03:46,502
Where's the money,
Lebowski?

65
00:03:46,542 --> 00:03:48,582
Where's the fucking
money, shithead?!

66
00:03:51,701 --> 00:03:54,100
It's down there somewhere.
let me take another look.

67
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,819
Don't fuck with us!

68
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:01,099
Your wife owes money
to Jackie Treehorn,

69
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:04,098
That means you own
money to Jackie Treehorn.

70
00:04:04,178 --> 00:04:07,177
Ever thus to
deadbeats, Lebowski.

71
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,696
No, no, don't do that

72
00:04:10,496 --> 00:04:12,456
Not on the rug, man.

73
00:04:12,536 --> 00:04:13,495
See?

74
00:04:13,575 --> 00:04:15,135
See what happens,
Lebowski?

75
00:04:15,135 --> 00:04:17,094
You see what happens?

76
00:04:17,094 --> 00:04:18,534
Nobody calls me
Lebowski.

77
00:04:18,534 --> 00:04:22,013
You got the wrong guy.
I'm The Dude, man.

78
00:04:22,133 --> 00:04:24,053
Your name's
Lebowski, Lebowski.

79
00:04:24,053 --> 00:04:26,012
Your wife is Bunny.

80
00:04:26,092 --> 00:04:29,571
My my wife..
my wife Bunny?

81
00:04:29,571 --> 00:04:32,090
Do you see a wedding
ring on my finger?

82
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,930
Does this place look
like I'm fucking married?

83
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:36,609
The toilet seat's up,
man.

84
00:04:44,527 --> 00:04:46,607
What the fuck
is this?

85
00:04:46,607 --> 00:04:49,726
Obviously,
you're not a golfer.

86
00:04:50,606 --> 00:04:52,525
Woo?

87
00:04:53,565 --> 00:04:56,884
Isn't this guy supposed
to be a millionaire?

88
00:04:59,243 --> 00:05:02,083
Yeah, what do you think?

89
00:05:02,123 --> 00:05:04,082
He looks like
a fucking loser.

90
00:05:04,162 --> 00:05:07,121
Hey, at least
I'm housebroken.

91
00:05:07,121 --> 00:05:09,081
Fucking time wasted.

92
00:05:09,081 --> 00:05:11,360
Thanks a lot,
asshole.

93
00:05:41,152 --> 00:05:44,591
# The man in me will do #

94
00:05:44,671 --> 00:05:48,031
# Nearly any task #

95
00:05:48,111 --> 00:05:51,110
# And as for compensation #

96
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:54,109
# There's a little
he would ask #

97
00:05:54,109 --> 00:05:57,548
# Take a woman like you #

98
00:05:57,588 --> 00:06:00,067
# To get through #

99
00:06:00,067 --> 00:06:02,707
# To the man in me #

100
00:06:05,586 --> 00:06:09,025
# The storm clouds
are raging #

101
00:06:09,025 --> 00:06:11,784
# All around my door #

102
00:06:12,584 --> 00:06:14,544
# I think to myself #

103
00:06:14,544 --> 00:06:18,583
# I might not
take it anymore #

104
00:06:18,663 --> 00:06:21,582
# Take a woman
like your kind #

105
00:06:21,662 --> 00:06:26,900
# To find the man in me #

106
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:31,659
# But, oh #

107
00:06:31,659 --> 00:06:34,698
# What a wonderful feeling #

108
00:06:36,138 --> 00:06:41,177
# Just to know
that you are near #

109
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:47,815
# That sets
my heart a-reelin' #

110
00:06:48,695 --> 00:06:51,774
# From my toes #

111
00:06:51,814 --> 00:06:55,653
# Up to my ears #

112
00:06:55,693 --> 00:06:59,172
# The man in me
will hide sometimes #

113
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,211
# To keep from being seen #

114
00:07:02,251 --> 00:07:04,211
# But that's just because #

115
00:07:04,211 --> 00:07:08,729
# He doesn't want to
turn into some machine #

116
00:07:08,769 --> 00:07:11,809
# Take a woman like you #

117
00:07:11,809 --> 00:07:13,728
# To get through #

118
00:07:13,768 --> 00:07:15,848
# To the man in me #

119
00:07:20,326 --> 00:07:21,886
I'm throwing
rocks tonight.

120
00:07:21,926 --> 00:07:23,366
Mark it, Dude.

121
00:07:23,406 --> 00:07:25,805
This was a valued rug.

122
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:27,444
This was a...

123
00:07:27,484 --> 00:07:29,924
Yeah, man, it really
tied the room together.

124
00:07:29,964 --> 00:07:31,883
So this was
a valued

125
00:07:31,923 --> 00:07:33,363
What tied the room
together, Dude?

126
00:07:33,403 --> 00:07:34,403
My rug.

127
00:07:34,443 --> 00:07:35,882
Were you listening to
The Dude's story, Donny?

128
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:36,922
What?

129
00:07:36,962 --> 00:07:38,322
Were you listening
to The Dude's story?

130
00:07:38,362 --> 00:07:39,921
I was bowling.

131
00:07:39,961 --> 00:07:42,441
So you have no frame
of reference here, Donny.

132
00:07:42,481 --> 00:07:43,840
You're like a child

133
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,440
who wanders in
in the middle of a movie

134
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,360
Walter, what's
the point, man?

135
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,319
There's no reason--
here's my point, Dude

136
00:07:48,359 --> 00:07:49,839
There's no fucking reason--

137
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:51,398
Yeah, Walter,
what's your point?

138
00:07:51,878 --> 00:07:53,358
Walter, what
is the point--

139
00:07:53,358 --> 00:07:55,317
Look, we all know
who is at fault here.

140
00:07:55,357 --> 00:07:57,277
What the fuck are
you talking about?

141
00:07:57,357 --> 00:07:59,316
No, what
the fuck are you--

142
00:08:01,436 --> 00:08:03,915
We're talking about unchecked
aggression here, Dude.

143
00:08:03,955 --> 00:08:05,315
What the fuck is
he talking about?

144
00:08:05,395 --> 00:08:06,514
My rug.

145
00:08:06,514 --> 00:08:07,954
Forget it, Donny.
you're out of your element.

146
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:09,913
Walter, the chinaman
who peed on my rug,

147
00:08:09,953 --> 00:08:11,993
I can't go
give him a bill.

148
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,912
So what the fuck
are you talking about?

149
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,352
What the fuck
are you talking about?

150
00:08:15,432 --> 00:08:17,391
The chinaman is not
the issue here, Dude.

151
00:08:17,391 --> 00:08:19,351
I'm talking about drawing
a line in the sand, Dude.

152
00:08:19,351 --> 00:08:21,830
Across this line,
you do not--

153
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:25,309
Also, Dude, chinaman is not
the preferred nomenclature.

154
00:08:25,429 --> 00:08:27,349
Asian-american,
please.

155
00:08:27,349 --> 00:08:30,348
Walter, this isn't a guy
who built the railroads here,

156
00:08:30,388 --> 00:08:31,868
this is a guy

157
00:08:31,868 --> 00:08:33,347
What the fuck
are you talking

158
00:08:33,427 --> 00:08:34,867
Walter,
he peed on my rug.

159
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:36,946
He peed on
The Dude's rug.

160
00:08:37,026 --> 00:08:38,906
Donny, you're
out of your element.

161
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:41,385
Dude, the chinaman
is not the issue here.

162
00:08:41,465 --> 00:08:42,425
So, ... who..

163
00:08:42,545 --> 00:08:43,904
Jeff Lebowski.

164
00:08:43,904 --> 00:08:45,384
The other
Jeffrey Lebowski,

165
00:08:45,384 --> 00:08:47,344
the millionaire.

166
00:08:47,344 --> 00:08:48,423
That's fucking
interesting, man.

167
00:08:48,423 --> 00:08:49,903
That's fucking
interesting.

168
00:08:49,903 --> 00:08:52,342
Plus, he has
the wealth, obviously,

169
00:08:52,422 --> 00:08:53,942
and the resources,

170
00:08:53,942 --> 00:08:55,381
so that
there's no reason

171
00:08:55,381 --> 00:08:56,941
there's no
fucking reason

172
00:08:57,021 --> 00:08:58,381
why his wife
should go out

173
00:08:58,381 --> 00:08:59,420
and owe money
all over town,

174
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,340
and then they come

175
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,420
and they pee on
your fucking rug!

176
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,459
Am I wrong? No.

177
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:04,499
Am I wrong?

178
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,498
Ok, then.

179
00:09:07,498 --> 00:09:09,458
That rug really tied
the room together,

180
00:09:09,538 --> 00:09:11,457
Did it not?

181
00:09:11,497 --> 00:09:12,417
Fuckin' a!

182
00:09:12,417 --> 00:09:13,857
And this guy
peed on it.

183
00:09:13,897 --> 00:09:14,896
Donny, please.

184
00:09:14,936 --> 00:09:16,336
You know, this
is the fucking guy

185
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:17,936
I could find this
fucking Lebowski guy.

186
00:09:17,936 --> 00:09:19,335
His name is Lebowski?

187
00:09:19,415 --> 00:09:20,895
That's your name, Dude.

188
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,414
This is the guy

189
00:09:22,414 --> 00:09:24,294
who should compensate me
for the fucking rug.

190
00:09:24,294 --> 00:09:25,933
His wife goes out

191
00:09:25,973 --> 00:09:27,373
and owes money
all over town,

192
00:09:27,413 --> 00:09:28,853
and they pee on my rug?

193
00:09:28,933 --> 00:09:30,932
They pee on
your fucking rug.

194
00:09:31,012 --> 00:09:32,372
They pee on
my fucking rug.

195
00:09:32,412 --> 00:09:33,891
That's right, Dude.

196
00:09:34,931 --> 00:09:37,570
They peed on
your fucking rug.

197
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:40,290
This is the study.

198
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,289
As you can see,
the various commendations...

199
00:09:42,369 --> 00:09:44,369
"Jeffrey Lebowski."

200
00:09:44,449 --> 00:09:46,848
Honorary degrees,
etcetera.

201
00:09:46,888 --> 00:09:48,288
very impressive.

202
00:09:48,368 --> 00:09:50,807
Oh, please feel free
to inspect them.

203
00:09:50,807 --> 00:09:52,766
Oh, no, I'm
not really that

204
00:09:52,846 --> 00:09:53,846
Oh, please, please.

205
00:09:53,886 --> 00:09:55,846
That is the key to
the city of Pasadena,

206
00:09:55,926 --> 00:09:57,805
Which Mr. Lebowski
received 2 years ago

207
00:09:57,885 --> 00:10:00,924
In recognition of
his various civic ...

208
00:10:01,004 --> 00:10:03,484
Oh, that's
the Los Angeles

209
00:10:03,524 --> 00:10:05,603
Chamber of Commerce
Business Achiever Award,

210
00:10:05,643 --> 00:10:06,923
which is given

211
00:10:07,003 --> 00:10:08,322
oh, not necessarily
given every year.

212
00:10:08,402 --> 00:10:11,881
Hey, is this,
is this him with Nancy?

213
00:10:11,921 --> 00:10:13,841
Yes, indeed,
that is Mr. Lebowski

214
00:10:13,921 --> 00:10:15,920
with the first lady, yes.
it was taken when

215
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,880
That's, Lebowski
on the left there?

216
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,959
Yeah, of course.
Mr. Lebowski on the left

217
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,479
so he's a cripple

218
00:10:22,479 --> 00:10:24,878
Uh, you know,
a handicapped guy?

219
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,917
Mr. Lebowski
is disabled, yes.

220
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:28,437
Uh, this picture
was taken

221
00:10:28,517 --> 00:10:30,996
when Mrs. Reagan was
first lady of the nation,

222
00:10:31,036 --> 00:10:33,476
Yes, yes.
Not of California.

223
00:10:33,476 --> 00:10:34,516
Pope John.

224
00:10:34,516 --> 00:10:36,355
..in fact, he met
privately with the President,

225
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:37,355
though unfortunately,

226
00:10:37,355 --> 00:10:39,434
There wasn't enough time
for a photo opportunity.

227
00:10:39,434 --> 00:10:40,874
Oh, Nancy's pretty good.

228
00:10:40,954 --> 00:10:42,913
Oh, wonderful woman.
we're very happy

229
00:10:42,913 --> 00:10:43,953
these are ...

230
00:10:43,953 --> 00:10:46,352
oh, those are Mr. Lebowski's
children, so to speak.

231
00:10:46,432 --> 00:10:48,392
Different mothers, huh?

232
00:10:48,392 --> 00:10:49,911
Racially, pretty cool.

233
00:10:51,391 --> 00:10:53,391
They're not literally
his children.

234
00:10:53,471 --> 00:10:55,870
They're the little
Lebowski Urban Achievers,

235
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,509
Inner-city children
of promise

236
00:10:57,509 --> 00:10:58,869
but without
the necessary means for

237
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,949
necessary means for
a higher education.

238
00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:02,988
So Mr. Lebowski
is committed

239
00:11:02,988 --> 00:11:04,828
to sending all
of them to college.

240
00:11:04,908 --> 00:11:05,867
Excuse me.

241
00:11:05,947 --> 00:11:07,827
Thank you. Thank you.

242
00:11:07,907 --> 00:11:08,787
Far out.

243
00:11:08,787 --> 00:11:10,866
Think he's got room
for one more?

244
00:11:13,945 --> 00:11:15,505
You never
went to college.

245
00:11:15,545 --> 00:11:16,944
Please,
don't touch that.

246
00:11:17,024 --> 00:11:18,704
Yeah, no, I did,
but, you know,

247
00:11:18,824 --> 00:11:20,743
I spent most
of my time, um,

248
00:11:20,783 --> 00:11:22,743
occupying various
administration buildings,

249
00:11:22,743 --> 00:11:25,182
smoking a lot
of thai stick,

250
00:11:25,222 --> 00:11:26,742
breaking into
the R.O.T.C.,

251
00:11:26,782 --> 00:11:28,221
and bowling.

252
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:29,781
to tell you
the truth, Brandt,

253
00:11:29,861 --> 00:11:31,181
I don't remember
most of it.

254
00:11:36,139 --> 00:11:40,178
Ok, sir, you're a Lebowski,
I'm a Lebowski,

255
00:11:40,298 --> 00:11:41,138
That's terrific.

256
00:11:41,218 --> 00:11:45,617
But I'm very busy,
as I imagine you are.

257
00:11:45,657 --> 00:11:47,576
What can I
do for you, sir?

258
00:11:47,616 --> 00:11:49,536
Uh, well, sir,
it's,

259
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:51,175
this rug I have.

260
00:11:51,215 --> 00:11:53,695
It really tied
the room together.

261
00:11:53,735 --> 00:11:55,734
You told Brandt on
the phone, he told me.

262
00:11:55,774 --> 00:11:58,214
Where do I fit in?

263
00:11:58,254 --> 00:11:59,653
Well, they were

264
00:11:59,693 --> 00:12:01,133
They were looking
for you, these 2 guys.

265
00:12:02,652 --> 00:12:03,692
I'll say it again.

266
00:12:03,732 --> 00:12:06,691
You told Brandt on
the phone, he told me.

267
00:12:06,731 --> 00:12:08,651
I know what happened.
Yes? Yes?

268
00:12:08,691 --> 00:12:10,090
Oh, so you know that

269
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,170
They were trying
to piss on your rug?

270
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:14,129
Did I urinate
on your rug?

271
00:12:14,169 --> 00:12:16,169
You mean, did you
personally come

272
00:12:16,209 --> 00:12:17,609
and pee on my rug?

273
00:12:17,688 --> 00:12:19,168
Hello! Do you
speak English, son?

274
00:12:19,168 --> 00:12:20,688
Parla usted ingles?

275
00:12:20,728 --> 00:12:24,167
I'll ask you again.
Did I urinate on your rug?

276
00:12:24,247 --> 00:12:27,246
No, like I said,
Woo peed on my rug.

277
00:12:27,286 --> 00:12:29,086
I just want to
understand this, sir.

278
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,565
Every time a rug
is micturated upon

279
00:12:31,605 --> 00:12:34,564
In this fair city, I have
to compensate the person

280
00:12:34,644 --> 00:12:36,084
Come on, man,

281
00:12:36,124 --> 00:12:38,163
I'm not trying
io scam anybody here.

282
00:12:38,203 --> 00:12:40,123
..you know,
I.. was just

283
00:12:40,203 --> 00:12:42,162
You were just
looking for a handout

284
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:44,122
like every other...

285
00:12:44,122 --> 00:12:47,121
Are you employed,
Mr. Lebowski?

286
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:48,720
Uh, wait, let me

287
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,680
let me explain
something to you.

288
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,239
I am not Mr. Lebowski.
You're Mr. Lebowski.

289
00:12:54,239 --> 00:12:56,678
I'm The Dude. So that's
what you call me,

290
00:12:56,758 --> 00:13:00,077
You know, that
or, his Dudeness,

291
00:13:00,157 --> 00:13:03,157
Or, Duder, or, you
know, el Duderino,

292
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:06,036
If you're not into
the whole brevity thing.

293
00:13:06,156 --> 00:13:09,155
Are you employed, sir?

294
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:10,675
Employed?

295
00:13:12,274 --> 00:13:13,674
You don't go out
looking for a job

296
00:13:13,754 --> 00:13:16,193
dressed like that,
do you, on a weekday?

297
00:13:16,273 --> 00:13:19,192
Is this a..
what day is this?

298
00:13:19,272 --> 00:13:21,232
Well, I do work, sir.

299
00:13:21,232 --> 00:13:22,791
So if you don't mind

300
00:13:22,871 --> 00:13:24,111
No, I do mind.

301
00:13:24,191 --> 00:13:25,751
Uh, The Dude minds.

302
00:13:25,751 --> 00:13:27,590
This will not stand,
you know.

303
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,630
This aggression
will not stand, man.

304
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:31,669
I mean, your wife owes

305
00:13:31,669 --> 00:13:34,668
My wife is not
the issue here!

306
00:13:34,668 --> 00:13:36,628
I hope that
someday my wife

307
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:38,707
will learn to live
on her allowance,

308
00:13:38,787 --> 00:13:40,707
which is ample,
but if she does not,

309
00:13:40,747 --> 00:13:42,706
that is her problem,
not mine,

310
00:13:42,706 --> 00:13:44,266
just as the rug
is your problem,

311
00:13:44,346 --> 00:13:46,705
just as every bum's
lot in life

312
00:13:46,745 --> 00:13:48,265
is his own
responsibility,

313
00:13:48,265 --> 00:13:50,704
regardless of who
he chooses to blame.

314
00:13:50,744 --> 00:13:54,623
I didn't blame anyone
for the loss of my legs.

315
00:13:54,663 --> 00:13:56,663
Some chinaman took them
from me in Korea.

316
00:13:56,703 --> 00:13:59,142
But I went out
and achieved anyway.

317
00:14:00,622 --> 00:14:02,941
I cannot solve
your problems, sir,

318
00:14:02,981 --> 00:14:04,780
only you can.

319
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:08,659
Oh, fuck it.

320
00:14:08,699 --> 00:14:10,219
Yes, that's your answer.

321
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:11,659
That's your answer
to everything.

322
00:14:11,699 --> 00:14:13,218
Tattoo it
on your forehead.

323
00:14:13,258 --> 00:14:16,097
Your revolution is
over, Mr. Lebowski!

324
00:14:16,177 --> 00:14:17,737
Condolences!

325
00:14:17,737 --> 00:14:19,177
The bums lost!

326
00:14:19,217 --> 00:14:22,616
My advice to you is to do
what your parents did!

327
00:14:22,656 --> 00:14:24,575
Get a job, sir!

328
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:26,655
The bums will always lose!

329
00:14:26,655 --> 00:14:28,614
Do you hear me,
Lebowski?!

330
00:14:28,654 --> 00:14:31,693
The bums
will always lose!

331
00:14:31,733 --> 00:14:35,212
How was your meeting,
Mr. Lebowski?

332
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:39,771
Ok. The old man told me to
take any rug in the house.

333
00:14:39,811 --> 00:14:41,411
Well, enjoy,

334
00:14:41,451 --> 00:14:43,850
and perhaps we'll see you
again sometime, Dude.

335
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:46,370
Yeah, sure, if I'm
in the neighborhood,

336
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:49,809
You know, and ...

337
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:53,328
I need to use the John.

338
00:15:02,285 --> 00:15:03,805
Blow on them.

339
00:15:04,845 --> 00:15:08,084
Go ahead, blow.

340
00:15:08,964 --> 00:15:12,443
You want me to blow
on your, toes?

341
00:15:14,482 --> 00:15:16,562
I can't blow that far.

342
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,280
Are you sure
he won't mind?

343
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,319
He really doesn't
care about anything.

344
00:15:26,319 --> 00:15:28,239
He's a nihilist.

345
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:30,238
Oh, and that
must be exhausting.

346
00:15:30,318 --> 00:15:31,838
You're not blowing.

347
00:15:31,838 --> 00:15:34,837
Our guest has to be getting
along, Mrs. Lebowski.

348
00:15:34,917 --> 00:15:38,716
Oh, you're Bunny.

349
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:41,955
I'll suck your cock
for $1,000.

350
00:15:45,834 --> 00:15:47,953
Wonderful woman.

351
00:15:48,033 --> 00:15:49,433
We're all..we're all
very fond of her.

352
00:15:49,473 --> 00:15:50,473
Very free-spirited.

353
00:15:50,513 --> 00:15:51,952
Brandt can't watch,
though,

354
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:53,512
Or he has
to pay 100.

355
00:15:53,592 --> 00:15:56,311
..that's marvelous.

356
00:15:58,071 --> 00:16:02,230
Uh, I'm just gonna
go find a cash machine.

357
00:16:06,589 --> 00:16:08,028
Slamming them
tonight.

358
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:10,028
You guys are
dead in the water.

359
00:16:10,028 --> 00:16:13,387
All right!
Way to go, Donny!

360
00:16:13,427 --> 00:16:16,986
If you will it,
it is no dream.

361
00:16:17,026 --> 00:16:18,945
You're fucking
20 minutes late, man.

362
00:16:18,985 --> 00:16:20,385
What the fuck is that?

363
00:16:20,465 --> 00:16:21,465
Theodore Herzel.

364
00:16:22,544 --> 00:16:25,024
The state of Israel.
If you will it, Dude,

365
00:16:25,064 --> 00:16:25,943
It is no dream.

366
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,463
What the fuck you
talking about, man?

367
00:16:27,543 --> 00:16:29,503
The carrier. What's
in the fucking carrier?

368
00:16:29,543 --> 00:16:30,862
Oh, Cynthia’s dog.

369
00:16:30,982 --> 00:16:33,422
I think
it's a Pomeranian.

370
00:16:33,462 --> 00:16:34,981
I can't leave him
home alone

371
00:16:35,101 --> 00:16:35,901
or he eats
the furniture.

372
00:16:35,941 --> 00:16:37,460
I'm watching it

373
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,460
while Cynthia
and Marty Ackerman

374
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,380
are in Hawaii.

375
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,980
You brought a fucking
Pomeranian bowling?

376
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,379
What do you mean,
"brought it bowling"?

377
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:43,819
I didn't rent it shoes,

378
00:16:43,899 --> 00:16:45,458
I'm not buying it
a fucking beer,

379
00:16:45,498 --> 00:16:47,418
he's not taking
your fucking turn, Dude.

380
00:16:47,418 --> 00:16:49,377
Man, if my
fucking ex-wife

381
00:16:49,417 --> 00:16:50,977
asked me to take care
of her fucking dog

382
00:16:51,017 --> 00:16:52,377
while she and her boyfriend
went to Honolulu,

383
00:16:52,457 --> 00:16:53,976
I'd tell her to
go fuck herself.

384
00:16:53,976 --> 00:16:55,456
Why can't she board it?

385
00:16:55,456 --> 00:16:57,575
First of all, Dude,
you don't have an ex.

386
00:16:57,575 --> 00:16:59,055
Secondly, this is
a fucking show dog

387
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,574
with fucking papers.

388
00:17:00,574 --> 00:17:02,054
You can't board it.
It gets upset.

389
00:17:02,134 --> 00:17:03,054
Its hair falls out.

390
00:17:04,093 --> 00:17:05,493
The fucking dog
has fucking papers.

391
00:17:05,613 --> 00:17:07,413
Over the line!

392
00:17:08,532 --> 00:17:09,932
I'm sorry, Smokey,
you were over the line.

393
00:17:09,932 --> 00:17:10,972
That's a foul.

394
00:17:10,972 --> 00:17:12,491
Bullshit.
Mark it 8, Dude.

395
00:17:12,571 --> 00:17:15,451
Uh, excuse me, mark it
zero. Next frame.

396
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,450
Bullshit, Walter.
Mark it 8, Dude.

397
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:20,529
Smokey, this is not
'nam, this is bowling.

398
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:21,449
There are rules.

399
00:17:21,529 --> 00:17:23,368
Hey, Walter, come on,
it's just

400
00:17:23,368 --> 00:17:24,408
Hey, man, it's Smokey.

401
00:17:24,408 --> 00:17:25,888
So his toe slipped
over a little.

402
00:17:25,888 --> 00:17:28,007
You know, it's
just a game, man.

403
00:17:28,007 --> 00:17:29,367
This is a league game.
This determines

404
00:17:29,447 --> 00:17:31,126
who enters
the next round-robin.

405
00:17:31,126 --> 00:17:32,006
Am I wrong?

406
00:17:32,006 --> 00:17:33,086
Yeah,
but I wasn't

407
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:33,966
Am I wrong?

408
00:17:34,046 --> 00:17:35,445
Yeah,
but I wasn't over.

409
00:17:35,525 --> 00:17:36,365
Give me
the marker, Dude.

410
00:17:36,445 --> 00:17:37,965
I'm marking an 8.

411
00:17:37,965 --> 00:17:39,924
Smokey, my friend,

412
00:17:40,004 --> 00:17:41,884
You're entering
a world of pain.

413
00:17:41,964 --> 00:17:42,923
Walter, man.

414
00:17:43,003 --> 00:17:44,803
You mark
that frame an 8,

415
00:17:44,843 --> 00:17:46,522
You're entering
a world of pain.

416
00:17:47,962 --> 00:17:49,921
A world of pain.

417
00:17:50,001 --> 00:17:52,001
Look, Dude,
this is your partner.

418
00:17:52,081 --> 00:17:54,520
Has the whole world
gone crazy?!

419
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,520
Am I the only one
around here

420
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,440
who gives a shit
about the rules?!

421
00:17:57,519 --> 00:17:58,919
Mark it zero!

422
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,479
They're calling
the cops, man.

423
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:01,518
Put the piece away.

424
00:18:01,518 --> 00:18:02,558
Mark it zero!

425
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:03,918
Walter, put
the piece away.

426
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,437
You think I'm
fucking around here?

427
00:18:06,437 --> 00:18:08,237
Mark it zero!

428
00:18:14,475 --> 00:18:16,994
All right,
it's fucking zero.

429
00:18:17,034 --> 00:18:19,514
You happy,
you crazy fuck?

430
00:18:21,513 --> 00:18:23,593
It's a league game,
Smoke.

431
00:18:26,032 --> 00:18:27,472
You can't do that, man.

432
00:18:27,512 --> 00:18:29,071
These guys, you know,
they're like me.

433
00:18:29,111 --> 00:18:30,591
They're pacifists.

434
00:18:30,631 --> 00:18:32,510
Smokey was a
conscientious objector.

435
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:33,990
You know, Dude,
I, myself,

436
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,029
dabbled in pacifism
at one point,

437
00:18:36,069 --> 00:18:36,949
not in 'nam,
of course.

438
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:40,548
And you know he's got
emotional problems, man.

439
00:18:40,588 --> 00:18:42,468
You mean,
beyond pacifism?

440
00:18:42,548 --> 00:18:45,387
He's fragile,
Very fragile.

441
00:18:45,467 --> 00:18:49,866
Huh. I did not know that.

442
00:18:51,945 --> 00:18:53,385
..it's all water
under the bridge,

443
00:18:53,385 --> 00:18:55,944
and we do enter
the next round-robin.

444
00:18:55,944 --> 00:18:56,984
Am I wrong?

445
00:18:56,984 --> 00:18:58,424
No, you're not wrong.

446
00:18:58,424 --> 00:18:59,343
Am I wrong?

447
00:18:59,383 --> 00:19:00,383
You're not wrong,
Walter,

448
00:19:00,423 --> 00:19:01,903
you're just an asshole!

449
00:19:01,903 --> 00:19:03,302
Ok, then.

450
00:19:03,382 --> 00:19:04,862
We play Quintana
and O’Brien next week.

451
00:19:04,942 --> 00:19:06,941
They should be pushovers.

452
00:19:08,421 --> 00:19:10,420
Man, will you just

453
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,900
Just take it easy,
man.

454
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,899
You know, that's your
answer for everything, Dude.

455
00:19:14,979 --> 00:19:16,259
And let me
point out something.

456
00:19:16,339 --> 00:19:18,938
Pacifism is not look
at our current situation

457
00:19:19,018 --> 00:19:20,978
with that
camelfucker in Iraq.

458
00:19:20,978 --> 00:19:22,897
Pacifism is not something
to hide behind.

459
00:19:22,897 --> 00:19:25,896
Just take it easy, man.

460
00:19:25,976 --> 00:19:27,296
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.

461
00:19:27,376 --> 00:19:29,775
Yeah, waving
the fucking gun around?

462
00:19:29,895 --> 00:19:31,415
Calmer than you are.

463
00:19:31,415 --> 00:19:33,374
Will you
just take it easy?

464
00:19:33,374 --> 00:19:36,014
Calmer than you are.

465
00:19:39,933 --> 00:19:41,892
Dude, this is Smokey.

466
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:43,372
Look, I don't want to
be a hard-on about this,

467
00:19:43,372 --> 00:19:44,891
and I know it
wasn't your fault,

468
00:19:44,971 --> 00:19:47,331
but I just thought
it was fair to tell you

469
00:19:47,531 --> 00:19:49,410
that Gilbert and I will be
submitting this to the league

470
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:51,410
and asking them to
set aside the round,

471
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:53,929
I don't know,
maybe forfeit it to us.

472
00:19:53,929 --> 00:19:57,368
So, like I say, just thought,
you know, fair warning.

473
00:19:57,368 --> 00:19:59,448
Tell Walter. I'm sorry.

474
00:20:00,887 --> 00:20:05,326
Mr. Lebowski, this
is Brandt at,

475
00:20:05,406 --> 00:20:07,965
well, at
Mr. Lebowski's office.

476
00:20:07,965 --> 00:20:11,085
Please call us as
soon as it's convenient.

477
00:20:13,044 --> 00:20:14,404
Mr. Lebowski,
this is Bill Selliger

478
00:20:14,444 --> 00:20:16,123
of the Southern Cal
Bowling League,

479
00:20:16,163 --> 00:20:18,083
and I just got
an informal report

480
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:21,642
that a member of your team,
a Walter Sobchak,

481
00:20:21,682 --> 00:20:24,201
drew a firearm
during league play.

482
00:20:24,961 --> 00:20:26,560
If this is true,
of course,

483
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,960
it contravenes a number
of the league's bylaws

484
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,560
and also article 27
of the league

485
00:20:32,959 --> 00:20:35,518
Dude, I..finally got..
I got the,

486
00:20:35,558 --> 00:20:37,598
the venue I wanted.

487
00:20:37,638 --> 00:20:39,557
I'm performing
my dance quintet,

488
00:20:39,597 --> 00:20:40,997
you know, my cycle,

489
00:20:40,997 --> 00:20:43,116
at Crane Jackson's
fountain street theater

490
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:44,596
on Tuesday night,

491
00:20:44,636 --> 00:20:46,515
and, well, I’d
love it if you came

492
00:20:46,515 --> 00:20:48,595
and gave me notes.

493
00:20:48,595 --> 00:20:50,594
I'll be there, man.

494
00:20:54,033 --> 00:20:56,393
tomorrow's
already the 10th.

495
00:20:56,393 --> 00:20:58,992
Far out.

496
00:21:01,071 --> 00:21:02,991
Oh. all right, ok.

497
00:21:03,071 --> 00:21:06,670
Just, just slip
the rent under my door.

498
00:21:09,629 --> 00:21:10,829
...serious infraction

499
00:21:10,829 --> 00:21:13,988
and examine your standing.
Thank you.

500
00:21:16,428 --> 00:21:18,467
Mr. Lebowski,
Brandt again.

501
00:21:18,507 --> 00:21:21,306
Please do call us as
soon as you get in,

502
00:21:21,386 --> 00:21:22,866
and I'll
send a limo.

503
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:24,386
I hope you're not
avoiding this call

504
00:21:24,386 --> 00:21:25,865
because of the rug..

505
00:21:25,945 --> 00:21:28,864
Which, I assure you,
is not a problem.

506
00:21:28,904 --> 00:21:31,424
We need your help,
and ...

507
00:21:31,504 --> 00:21:33,903
Well, we'd very much
like to see you.

508
00:21:33,903 --> 00:21:36,462
Thank you.
it's Brandt.

509
00:21:37,382 --> 00:21:39,462
We've had some
terrible news.

510
00:21:39,462 --> 00:21:41,981
Mr. Lebowski's in seclusion
in the west wing.

511
00:21:53,898 --> 00:21:55,377
Funny...

512
00:21:56,417 --> 00:22:00,376
I can look back
on a life of achievement,

513
00:22:00,456 --> 00:22:01,856
challenges met,

514
00:22:01,936 --> 00:22:04,335
competitors bested,

515
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:06,974
obstacles overcome.

516
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:11,373
I've accomplished more
than most men

517
00:22:11,373 --> 00:22:14,492
and without the use
of my legs.

518
00:22:17,332 --> 00:22:21,811
What makes a man,
Mr. Lebowski?

519
00:22:25,849 --> 00:22:28,329
I..
don't know, sir.

520
00:22:28,329 --> 00:22:32,528
Is it being prepared
to do the right thing?

521
00:22:33,847 --> 00:22:35,807
Whatever the cost?

522
00:22:35,847 --> 00:22:38,326
Isn't that what
makes a man?

523
00:22:38,366 --> 00:22:42,005
Sure, that
and a pair of testicles.

524
00:22:42,045 --> 00:22:43,405
You're joking.

525
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:44,924
But...

526
00:22:46,404 --> 00:22:48,324
Perhaps you're right.

527
00:22:48,364 --> 00:22:51,403
You mind
if I do a "j"?

528
00:22:51,443 --> 00:22:53,882
Bunny...

529
00:22:55,482 --> 00:22:56,961
Excuse me?

530
00:22:57,001 --> 00:22:59,961
Bunny Lebowski,

531
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:02,960
She is the light
of my life.

532
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,719
Are you surprised
at my tears, sir?

533
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:09,358
Fuckin' a.

534
00:23:09,438 --> 00:23:18,076
Strong men also cry.

535
00:23:20,395 --> 00:23:23,434
I received this fax
this morning.

536
00:23:25,434 --> 00:23:27,433
As you can see,

537
00:23:27,513 --> 00:23:29,913
it is a ransom note.

538
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:32,472
"We have Bunnie."

539
00:23:32,472 --> 00:23:34,991
Written by men who
are unable to achieve

540
00:23:34,991 --> 00:23:37,391
on a level field
of play.

541
00:23:37,511 --> 00:23:38,910
"Gather one million dollars

542
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:42,789
in unmarked,
non-consecutive twenties."

543
00:23:42,869 --> 00:23:43,829
Weaklings.

544
00:23:43,909 --> 00:23:45,029
"Await instructions."

545
00:23:45,109 --> 00:23:45,909
Bums!

546
00:23:45,988 --> 00:23:46,828
"No funny stuff."

547
00:23:46,908 --> 00:23:49,907
Bummer.

548
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:53,347
This is a bummer,
man.

549
00:23:53,467 --> 00:23:55,466
That's,
that's a bummer.

550
00:23:55,546 --> 00:24:00,185
Brandt will fill you in
on the details.

551
00:24:13,341 --> 00:24:15,301
Mr. Lebowski
is prepared to make

552
00:24:15,381 --> 00:24:18,340
a generous offer to you
to act as courier

553
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:20,339
once we get instructions
for the money.

554
00:24:20,339 --> 00:24:21,859
Why me, man?

555
00:24:21,939 --> 00:24:24,898
He believes the culprits
might be the very people

556
00:24:24,938 --> 00:24:27,938
who ...
soiled your rug,

557
00:24:27,938 --> 00:24:29,337
and you're in
a unique position

558
00:24:29,417 --> 00:24:31,337
to confirm
or disconfirm

559
00:24:31,337 --> 00:24:32,896
that suspicion.

560
00:24:32,976 --> 00:24:34,936
He thinks the
carpet pissers did this?

561
00:24:34,936 --> 00:24:37,495
Well, Dude,
we just don't know.

562
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:16,509
Fucking Quintana.

563
00:26:16,589 --> 00:26:19,468
That creep
can roll, man.

564
00:26:19,468 --> 00:26:20,988
Yeah, but he's
a pervert, Dude.

565
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:26,546
No. He's a sex offender
with a record.

566
00:26:26,586 --> 00:26:27,506
He did 6 months at chino

567
00:26:27,506 --> 00:26:29,386
for exposing himself
to an 8-year-old.

568
00:26:29,426 --> 00:26:31,465
When he
moved to Hollywood,

569
00:26:31,505 --> 00:26:32,425
He had to go
door-to-door

570
00:26:32,505 --> 00:26:34,504
to tell everyone
he was a pederast.

571
00:26:34,664 --> 00:26:37,064
What's
a pederast, Walter?

572
00:26:37,144 --> 00:26:38,983
Shut the fuck up,
Donny.

573
00:26:41,982 --> 00:26:43,542
How much
they give you?

574
00:26:43,582 --> 00:26:45,541
20 grand, man.

575
00:26:45,541 --> 00:26:47,621
And, of course, I still
get to keep the rug.

576
00:26:47,621 --> 00:26:48,501
Just for making
the hand-off?

577
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:52,140
Yeah. They gave,
Dude a beeper.

578
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,019
Now, so whenever
these guys call

579
00:26:54,099 --> 00:26:55,099
What if it's
during a game?

580
00:26:55,139 --> 00:26:57,458
Oh, I told them if it
was during league play...

581
00:26:57,498 --> 00:26:58,898
What's during
league play?

582
00:26:58,938 --> 00:27:00,538
Life does not
stop and start

583
00:27:00,578 --> 00:27:01,497
at your convenience,

584
00:27:01,497 --> 00:27:03,537
you miserable
piece of shit.

585
00:27:03,577 --> 00:27:04,457
I figure...

586
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:05,496
What's wrong
with Walter, Dude?

587
00:27:05,536 --> 00:27:06,976
I figure
it's easy money.

588
00:27:07,016 --> 00:27:08,016
It's all
pretty harmless.

589
00:27:08,056 --> 00:27:09,495
She probably
kidnapped herself.

590
00:27:10,575 --> 00:27:11,575
What do you mean, Dude?

591
00:27:11,655 --> 00:27:13,534
Rug pee-ers
did not do this.

592
00:27:13,574 --> 00:27:15,014
Look at it.

593
00:27:15,054 --> 00:27:16,573
A young trophy wife

594
00:27:16,613 --> 00:27:18,613
marries this guy
for his money.

595
00:27:18,653 --> 00:27:21,012
She figures he isn't
giving her enough.

596
00:27:21,052 --> 00:27:22,532
You know, she owes money
all over town.

597
00:27:22,572 --> 00:27:25,451
That fuckin'...
Bitch.

598
00:27:25,491 --> 00:27:27,411
It's all goddamn
fake, man.

599
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:29,010
It's like Lenin said.

600
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:32,009
You look for the person
who will benefit,

601
00:27:32,049 --> 00:27:34,529
and,
you know...

602
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:35,448
I am the walrus?

603
00:27:35,448 --> 00:27:37,528
You know,
you'll ...

604
00:27:37,528 --> 00:27:39,047
You know what
I'm trying to say.

605
00:27:39,087 --> 00:27:40,087
I am the walrus.

606
00:27:40,127 --> 00:27:42,047
That fuckin' bitch!

607
00:27:43,086 --> 00:27:44,006
I am the walrus.

608
00:27:44,046 --> 00:27:45,966
Shut the fuck up,
Donny!

609
00:27:46,046 --> 00:27:49,485
V.I. Lenin. Vladimir
Ilyich Ulyanov!

610
00:27:49,565 --> 00:27:50,524
What the fuck
is he talking about?

611
00:27:50,604 --> 00:27:51,884
Fucking exactly
what happened.

612
00:27:51,964 --> 00:27:53,924
That makes me
fucking sick.

613
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:54,963
What do you care,
Walter?

614
00:27:55,003 --> 00:27:56,963
Those rich fucks.

615
00:27:57,043 --> 00:27:59,002
This whole
fuckin' thing.

616
00:27:59,002 --> 00:28:01,082
I did not watch
my buddies die

617
00:28:01,082 --> 00:28:02,001
facedown in the mud

618
00:28:02,081 --> 00:28:03,641
so that this
fucking strumpet,

619
00:28:03,641 --> 00:28:05,001
This fucking whore

620
00:28:05,081 --> 00:28:07,560
I don't see any connection
to Vietnam, man.

621
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,600
Well, there's
a literal connection.

622
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,559
No, Walter, face it,
there isn't any connection.

623
00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:12,119
Your roll.

624
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:13,638
Have it your way,
but my point is

625
00:28:13,638 --> 00:28:14,678
Your roll.

626
00:28:14,678 --> 00:28:15,598
Your roll.
My point is

627
00:28:15,598 --> 00:28:17,397
Are you ready
to be fucked, man?

628
00:28:17,517 --> 00:28:22,596
I see you roll your way
into the semis.

629
00:28:22,596 --> 00:28:23,996
Dios mio, man.

630
00:28:24,076 --> 00:28:27,515
Liam and me, we're
gonna fuck you up.

631
00:28:29,114 --> 00:28:31,514
Well...you know,
that's just like ...

632
00:28:31,514 --> 00:28:34,393
Your opinion, man.

633
00:28:34,473 --> 00:28:38,112
Let me tell you
something, pendejo,

634
00:28:38,112 --> 00:28:41,111
you pull any
crazy shit with us,

635
00:28:41,191 --> 00:28:43,591
you flash a piece out
on the lanes,

636
00:28:43,631 --> 00:28:46,150
I'll take it away from you
and stick it up your ass

637
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:47,989
and pull
The fuckin' trigger

638
00:28:48,069 --> 00:28:50,349
till it goes click.

639
00:28:51,548 --> 00:28:52,468
Jesus.

640
00:28:52,548 --> 00:28:54,028
You said it, man.

641
00:28:54,028 --> 00:28:58,667
Nobody fucks
with the Jesus.

642
00:29:03,145 --> 00:29:05,425
8-year-olds, Dude.

643
00:29:51,453 --> 00:29:54,012
# The man in me will do #

644
00:29:54,972 --> 00:29:57,851
# Nearly any task #

645
00:29:57,851 --> 00:30:00,850
# And as for compensation #

646
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:03,370
# There's little
he will ask #

647
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:08,248
# Take a woman
like you #

648
00:30:08,248 --> 00:30:10,408
# To get through #

649
00:30:10,528 --> 00:30:12,447
# To the man in me #

650
00:30:15,407 --> 00:30:18,766
# The storm clouds
are raging #

651
00:30:18,846 --> 00:30:22,325
# All around my door #

652
00:30:22,405 --> 00:30:24,284
# I think to myself #

653
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:28,763
# I might not take it
anymore #

654
00:30:28,883 --> 00:30:31,922
# Take a woman
like your kind #

655
00:30:32,002 --> 00:30:33,802
# To find #

656
00:30:33,802 --> 00:30:36,761
# The man in me #

657
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,359
# What a wonderful feeling #

658
00:30:46,318 --> 00:30:51,557
# Just to know
that you are near... #

659
00:31:09,392 --> 00:31:10,792
They called about
80 minutes ago.

660
00:31:10,912 --> 00:31:11,752
They want you
to take the money,

661
00:31:11,832 --> 00:31:13,871
drive north on the 405.
They will call you

662
00:31:13,911 --> 00:31:15,871
on the portable phone
with instructions

663
00:31:15,871 --> 00:31:16,750
in about 40 minutes.

664
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:18,830
One person only. They
were very clear on that,

665
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:20,869
Or I'd go with you.
One person only.

666
00:31:20,909 --> 00:31:21,909
What happened to your jaw?

667
00:31:21,949 --> 00:31:24,029
Oh, nothin',
you know.

668
00:31:24,828 --> 00:31:26,908
Here's the money.

669
00:31:27,828 --> 00:31:29,347
And the phone.

670
00:31:29,427 --> 00:31:32,386
Please, Dude, follow whatever
instructions they give.

671
00:31:32,426 --> 00:31:33,426
All right.

672
00:31:33,466 --> 00:31:35,785
Her life is in your hands.

673
00:31:35,825 --> 00:31:36,825
Oh, man,
don't say that.

674
00:31:36,865 --> 00:31:38,865
Mr. Lebowski asked me
to repeat that.

675
00:31:38,905 --> 00:31:39,904
Her life is in your hands.

676
00:31:39,944 --> 00:31:40,824
Oh, shit, man.

677
00:31:40,864 --> 00:31:43,383
Her life is in
your hands, Dude.

678
00:31:43,423 --> 00:31:45,823
Report back to us
as soon as it's done.

679
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,860
Where the fuck
are you goin', man?

680
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,460
Take the ringer.
I'll drive.

681
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,419
What? The what?

682
00:32:00,459 --> 00:32:01,899
The ringer.

683
00:32:01,899 --> 00:32:03,938
The ringer,
Dude.

684
00:32:11,456 --> 00:32:13,855
Have they
Called yet? What the

685
00:32:13,935 --> 00:32:15,335
What the hell is this?

686
00:32:15,415 --> 00:32:16,935
My dirty undies,
Dude.

687
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,334
Laundry.
The whites.

688
00:32:18,414 --> 00:32:20,854
Walter, I'm sure
there's a reason

689
00:32:20,934 --> 00:32:22,453
you brought
your dirty undies, man.

690
00:32:22,453 --> 00:32:23,853
That's right, Dude.
The weight.

691
00:32:23,933 --> 00:32:25,892
The ringer
cannot look empty.

692
00:32:25,892 --> 00:32:27,812
Walter, what the fuck
are you thinking, man?

693
00:32:27,812 --> 00:32:29,971
You're right, Dude.
I got to thinking.

694
00:32:29,971 --> 00:32:31,291
I got to thinking
why should we settle

695
00:32:31,371 --> 00:32:32,891
for a measly fuckin'
20 grand

696
00:32:32,891 --> 00:32:34,290
We? What the fuck we?

697
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:35,730
You said you just wanted
to come along.

698
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:36,809
My point, Dude, is

699
00:32:36,889 --> 00:32:38,289
why should we
settle for 20 grand

700
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,369
when we can keep
the entire million?

701
00:32:40,369 --> 00:32:42,328
Am I wrong?
Yes, you're wrong.

702
00:32:42,408 --> 00:32:43,808
This isn't
a fuckin' game, man.

703
00:32:43,808 --> 00:32:46,327
Oh, but it is a game.
You said so yourself.

704
00:32:46,327 --> 00:32:47,967
She kidnapped herself.

705
00:32:47,967 --> 00:32:48,966
I said I thought

706
00:32:54,965 --> 00:32:56,524
Dude here.

707
00:32:56,604 --> 00:32:58,524
Who is this?

708
00:32:58,564 --> 00:33:01,363
Dude the bagman, man.
Where do you want us to go?

709
00:33:01,403 --> 00:33:02,883
Us?

710
00:33:07,202 --> 00:33:09,881
Yeah, you know,
me and the driver.

711
00:33:09,881 --> 00:33:12,440
I'm not handling the money,
driving the car,

712
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,920
and talking on the phone
all by my

713
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,239
Shut the fuck up!

714
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:16,879
Dude, are you
fuckin' this up?

715
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:18,399
Who is that?

716
00:33:19,398 --> 00:33:21,318
That is the driver.

717
00:33:21,358 --> 00:33:23,837
I told you

718
00:33:24,957 --> 00:33:25,957
What the fuck's
goin' on?

719
00:33:25,997 --> 00:33:27,876
Walter! What the fuck
is goin' on?

720
00:33:27,956 --> 00:33:28,796
He hung up, man!

721
00:33:28,836 --> 00:33:31,835
You fucked it up!

722
00:33:31,915 --> 00:33:33,475
Her life was
in our hands, man.

723
00:33:33,475 --> 00:33:34,314
Easy, Dude.

724
00:33:34,394 --> 00:33:36,394
We're screwed now.
We don't get shit.

725
00:33:36,434 --> 00:33:38,473
They're gonna kill her.

726
00:33:38,513 --> 00:33:39,393
We're fucked, Walter.

727
00:33:39,433 --> 00:33:41,113
Nothing is fucked,
Dude.

728
00:33:41,233 --> 00:33:43,592
Come on, you're
being very un-Dude.

729
00:33:43,672 --> 00:33:45,032
They'll call back.

730
00:33:45,112 --> 00:33:46,711
Look,
she kidnapped

731
00:33:47,631 --> 00:33:49,550
You see? Nothing's
fucked here, Dude.

732
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:51,150
Nothing is fucked.

733
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:53,109
They're a bunch of
fuckin' amateurs!

734
00:33:53,149 --> 00:33:56,069
Hey, Walter, will you
just shut the fuck up?

735
00:33:56,109 --> 00:33:58,508
Don't say peep while I'm
doin' business here, man.

736
00:33:58,588 --> 00:34:00,588
Ok, Dude,
have it your way.

737
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,027
But they're amateurs.

738
00:34:08,066 --> 00:34:09,065
Ok, we proceed.

739
00:34:09,065 --> 00:34:11,025
But only if there's
no funny stuff.

740
00:34:12,624 --> 00:34:14,104
So no funny stuff, ok?

741
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:17,703
Just tell me where the fuck
you want us to go.

742
00:34:21,422 --> 00:34:22,742
That was the sign, man.

743
00:34:22,782 --> 00:34:26,901
So all we gotta do
is get her back,

744
00:34:27,141 --> 00:34:29,100
No one's in a position
to complain,

745
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:31,180
And we keep
the baksheesh.

746
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,099
Yeah, terrific, Walter,

747
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:34,179
but you haven't told me how
we're gonna get her back.

748
00:34:34,259 --> 00:34:35,178
Where is she?

749
00:34:35,178 --> 00:34:36,658
That's the simple part,
Dude.

750
00:34:36,738 --> 00:34:38,138
We make the hand-off,

751
00:34:38,138 --> 00:34:40,657
I grab one of 'em,
beat it out of him.

752
00:34:42,297 --> 00:34:43,696
Yeah. That's
a great plan.

753
00:34:43,776 --> 00:34:46,216
Walter, that's
fucking ingenious,

754
00:34:46,336 --> 00:34:47,695
If I understand it
correctly.

755
00:34:47,695 --> 00:34:49,175
It's a Swiss
fuckin' watch.

756
00:34:49,255 --> 00:34:50,095
That's right, Dude.

757
00:34:50,175 --> 00:34:52,134
The beauty of this
is its simplicity.

758
00:34:52,134 --> 00:34:54,094
Once a plan
gets too complex,

759
00:34:54,094 --> 00:34:55,613
everything
can go wrong.

760
00:34:55,613 --> 00:34:57,693
If there's one thing I
learned in 'nam, it's

761
00:35:02,731 --> 00:35:04,611
You're coming
to a wooden bridge.

762
00:35:04,691 --> 00:35:06,050
When you cross
the bridge,

763
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,090
you throw the bag

764
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:09,170
from the left window
of the moving car.

765
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:10,649
You're being watched.

766
00:35:12,689 --> 00:35:14,128
What'd he say?
Where's the hand-off?

767
00:35:14,208 --> 00:35:15,688
There is no fuckin'
hand-off, man.

768
00:35:15,688 --> 00:35:17,607
At the wooden bridge, we throw
the money out of the car.

769
00:35:18,847 --> 00:35:20,647
We throw the money
out of the moving car.

770
00:35:20,727 --> 00:35:23,166
No, we can't
do that, Dude.

771
00:35:23,206 --> 00:35:25,085
That fucks up
our plan.

772
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:27,165
Well, call 'em up and
explain it to them, Walter.

773
00:35:27,205 --> 00:35:28,684
Your plan
is so fuckin' simple

774
00:35:28,724 --> 00:35:30,204
I'm sure they'll
fuckin' understand it.

775
00:35:30,204 --> 00:35:31,724
That's the beauty of it.

776
00:35:31,804 --> 00:35:32,643
Wooden bridge, huh?

777
00:35:32,683 --> 00:35:33,683
I'm throwin' the money,
Walter.

778
00:35:33,723 --> 00:35:35,203
We're not fuckin'
around, man.

779
00:35:35,203 --> 00:35:36,722
Ok, Dude,
bridge is comin' up.

780
00:35:36,762 --> 00:35:37,642
Give me the ringer,
chop-chop.

781
00:35:37,682 --> 00:35:39,202
Fuck that, Walter.
I love ya,

782
00:35:39,282 --> 00:35:41,761
but sooner or later you're
gonna have to face the fact

783
00:35:41,801 --> 00:35:42,801
you're a goddamn moron.

784
00:35:42,841 --> 00:35:44,240
Ok, Dude.
No time to argue.

785
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,200
Hey, man.
The bridge.

786
00:35:47,759 --> 00:35:49,719
There goes the ringer!

787
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:52,198
What the fuck?!

788
00:35:52,238 --> 00:35:53,598
Here, Dude, your wheel.

789
00:35:53,638 --> 00:35:55,997
At 15 mph, I roll out.

790
00:35:56,077 --> 00:35:57,677
I double back, grab one,
and beat it out of him.

791
00:35:57,757 --> 00:35:59,116
The Uzi.
Uzi?!

792
00:35:59,196 --> 00:36:01,156
You didn't think I was
rolling out of here naked?

793
00:36:01,196 --> 00:36:02,196
Walter, please..

794
00:36:02,236 --> 00:36:04,155
15, Dude. This is it.
Let's take that hill!

795
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:33,108
We have it!

796
00:36:33,148 --> 00:36:35,707
We...have it!

797
00:36:49,783 --> 00:36:51,623
Aw, fuck it, Dude.

798
00:36:51,623 --> 00:36:53,182
Let's go bowling.

799
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:33,292
Etz chaim he, Dude,

800
00:37:33,332 --> 00:37:35,251
as the ex used to say.

801
00:37:35,251 --> 00:37:37,171
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

802
00:37:37,291 --> 00:37:39,130
What the fuck are we
gonna tell Lebowski?

803
00:37:43,769 --> 00:37:45,729
Well, what exactly
is the problem?

804
00:37:45,729 --> 00:37:47,808
The problem is

805
00:37:48,688 --> 00:37:49,728
What do you mean,
What's the

806
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:52,127
There was no...

807
00:37:52,167 --> 00:37:54,806
We..didn't ...

808
00:37:55,726 --> 00:37:58,205
They're gonna kill
that poor woman, man.

809
00:37:58,245 --> 00:37:59,605
What the fuck are you
talking about?

810
00:37:59,645 --> 00:38:00,645
The poor woman

811
00:38:00,765 --> 00:38:01,684
that poor slut

812
00:38:01,804 --> 00:38:02,644
kidnapped herself.

813
00:38:02,684 --> 00:38:04,284
Come on, Dude,
you said so yourself.

814
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:06,283
Man, I said I thought
she kidnapped herself.

815
00:38:06,363 --> 00:38:07,683
You're the one who's
so fuckin' certain.

816
00:38:07,763 --> 00:38:09,242
That's right, Dude.

817
00:38:09,282 --> 00:38:10,842
100% certain.

818
00:38:10,882 --> 00:38:12,362
They posted the next round
for the tournament.

819
00:38:12,362 --> 00:38:14,881
Donny, shut the fuck
when do we play?

820
00:38:14,921 --> 00:38:15,681
This Saturday.

821
00:38:15,721 --> 00:38:17,760
Saturday? Well, they
have to reschedule.

822
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,280
Walter, what am I
gonna tell Lebowski?

823
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,799
I told that fuck down
at the league office

824
00:38:22,799 --> 00:38:24,278
Who's in charge
of scheduling?

825
00:38:25,398 --> 00:38:27,278
I told that kraut
a fuckin' thousand times

826
00:38:27,278 --> 00:38:28,477
I don't roll
on Shabbos.

827
00:38:28,517 --> 00:38:29,837
He already Walter
posted it.

828
00:38:29,877 --> 00:38:31,437
Well, he can fuckin'
unpost it!

829
00:38:31,437 --> 00:38:32,916
Who gives a shit?!

830
00:38:32,956 --> 00:38:34,756
They're gonna kill
that poor woman, man.

831
00:38:34,836 --> 00:38:36,355
What am I gonna tell
Lebowski?

832
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,795
..eventually she'll get tired
of her little game

833
00:38:38,875 --> 00:38:40,274
and, you know,
wander on back.

834
00:38:40,314 --> 00:38:41,834
How come you don't roll
on Saturday, Walter?

835
00:38:41,834 --> 00:38:42,794
I'm Shomer Shabbos.

836
00:38:42,834 --> 00:38:43,873
What's that, Walter?

837
00:38:43,913 --> 00:38:44,753
Yeah,
and in the meantime,

838
00:38:44,873 --> 00:38:46,353
What do I tell
Lebowski?

839
00:38:46,353 --> 00:38:47,872
Saturday, Donny,
is Shabbos,

840
00:38:47,872 --> 00:38:49,832
The jewish day of rest.
That means I don't work,

841
00:38:49,832 --> 00:38:52,791
I don't drive a car,
I don't fuckin' ride in a car,

842
00:38:52,911 --> 00:38:54,870
I don't handle money,
I don't turn on the oven,

843
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:57,390
and I sure as shit
don't fucking roll!

844
00:38:58,909 --> 00:39:00,869
Shomer Shabbos!

845
00:39:03,748 --> 00:39:05,268
Shomer fucking Shabbos.

846
00:39:05,268 --> 00:39:07,307
Oh, fuck! That's it!
I'm outta here.

847
00:39:07,387 --> 00:39:08,867
Oh, come on, Dude.

848
00:39:12,866 --> 00:39:15,865
Look, you just tell him

849
00:39:15,865 --> 00:39:17,265
Tell him we made the drop,

850
00:39:17,385 --> 00:39:18,744
and everything went,
you know...

851
00:39:18,824 --> 00:39:19,864
Oh, yeah,
how'd it go?

852
00:39:19,864 --> 00:39:21,743
Went all right. Dude's car
got a little dinged up.

853
00:39:21,823 --> 00:39:24,303
Walter, we didn't make
the fuckin' hand-off, man.

854
00:39:24,383 --> 00:39:26,382
They didn't get
the fuckin' money!

855
00:39:26,462 --> 00:39:27,822
And they're gonna..

856
00:39:27,862 --> 00:39:29,421
They're gonna kill
that poor woman.

857
00:39:29,461 --> 00:39:32,181
They're gonna kill
that poor woman

858
00:39:32,261 --> 00:39:33,820
Hey, Walter, if you
can't ride in a car,

859
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:35,260
how do you get around
on shammos?

860
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:36,819
Really, Dude,
you surprise me.

861
00:39:36,899 --> 00:39:39,819
They're not gonna kill shit,
they're not gonna do shit.

862
00:39:39,899 --> 00:39:40,778
What can they do to her?

863
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:41,818
They're a bunch
of fuckin' amateurs,

864
00:39:41,818 --> 00:39:43,258
And meanwhile,
look at the bottom line.

865
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:45,377
Who's sittin' on
a million fucking dollars?

866
00:39:46,937 --> 00:39:48,896
Who's got a fuckin' million
fuckin' dollars

867
00:39:48,976 --> 00:39:50,336
sitting in the trunk
of our car?

868
00:39:50,376 --> 00:39:51,376
Our car, Walter?

869
00:39:51,416 --> 00:39:53,375
And what do they got?
My dirty undies.

870
00:39:53,455 --> 00:39:55,375
My fuckin' whites.

871
00:40:00,933 --> 00:40:02,813
Say, Dude.

872
00:40:02,853 --> 00:40:04,372
Where is your car?

873
00:40:05,412 --> 00:40:06,772
Who's got your
undies, Walter?

874
00:40:06,812 --> 00:40:07,851
Where's your car, Dude?

875
00:40:07,891 --> 00:40:10,411
You don't know,
Walter?

876
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:13,410
It was parked
in a handicap zone.

877
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:14,370
Perhaps they towed it.

878
00:40:15,969 --> 00:40:18,369
You fuckin' know
it's been stolen.

879
00:40:18,409 --> 00:40:21,528
Well, certainly that's
a possibility, Dude.

880
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:23,887
Oh, fuck it.

881
00:40:26,846 --> 00:40:28,286
Where you goin', Dude?

882
00:40:28,406 --> 00:40:29,846
I'm goin' home, Donny.

883
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:31,805
Phone's ringing, Dude.

884
00:40:31,845 --> 00:40:33,925
Thank you, Donny.

885
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,640
Green.

886
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,599
Some, brown or...

887
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:58,158
Rust coloration.

888
00:40:58,158 --> 00:41:01,157
And was there anything
of value in the car?

889
00:41:02,597 --> 00:41:05,636
...a tape deck,

890
00:41:05,636 --> 00:41:07,116
some Creedence tapes,

891
00:41:07,116 --> 00:41:10,115
and there was a...

892
00:41:10,115 --> 00:41:13,274
my briefcase.

893
00:41:14,994 --> 00:41:17,073
In the briefcase?

894
00:41:18,153 --> 00:41:20,112
..papers.

895
00:41:20,192 --> 00:41:22,192
You know
just papers.

896
00:41:22,272 --> 00:41:25,471
You know,
my papers.

897
00:41:25,591 --> 00:41:27,071
Business papers.

898
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:30,550
And what do you do,
Sir?

899
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:32,149
I'm unemployed.

900
00:41:36,068 --> 00:41:38,268
My rug was
also stolen.

901
00:41:38,268 --> 00:41:40,187
Your rug was in the car?

902
00:41:40,227 --> 00:41:41,227
No, here.

903
00:41:43,306 --> 00:41:44,746
Separate incidents?

904
00:41:48,265 --> 00:41:52,104
Do you find them much,
these stolen cars?

905
00:41:52,104 --> 00:41:54,623
Sometimes.

906
00:41:54,663 --> 00:41:56,703
Wouldn't hold out much hope
for the tape deck, though.

907
00:41:56,743 --> 00:41:58,702
Or the Creedence.

908
00:41:58,702 --> 00:42:01,702
Well, what about...

909
00:42:02,541 --> 00:42:03,541
The briefcase?

910
00:42:03,581 --> 00:42:05,061
Mr. Lebowski,
I'd like to see you.

911
00:42:05,101 --> 00:42:07,180
Call when you get home,
and I'll send a car for you.

912
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,060
My name is Maude Lebowski.

913
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:10,579
I'm the one
who took your rug.

914
00:42:11,659 --> 00:42:15,858
Guess we can close
the file on that one.

915
00:43:02,326 --> 00:43:05,325
El Franco,
ay`dame abajo.

916
00:43:05,325 --> 00:43:09,004
I'll be with you
in a moment, Mr. Lebowski.

917
00:43:26,679 --> 00:43:30,238
Does the female form make you
uncomfortable, Mr. Lebowski?

918
00:43:30,238 --> 00:43:32,838
..is that what this
is a picture of?

919
00:43:32,918 --> 00:43:34,397
In a sense, yes.

920
00:43:34,397 --> 00:43:37,277
My art has been commended
as being strongly vaginal,

921
00:43:37,356 --> 00:43:38,316
which bothers some men.

922
00:43:38,396 --> 00:43:41,315
The word itself makes
some men uncomfortable.

923
00:43:41,395 --> 00:43:42,715
Vagina.

924
00:43:42,755 --> 00:43:44,235
Oh, yeah?

925
00:43:44,275 --> 00:43:46,194
Yes, they don't like hearing it
and find it difficult to say,

926
00:43:46,314 --> 00:43:47,714
whereas without
batting an eye,

927
00:43:47,794 --> 00:43:49,793
a man will refer to
his dick or his rod

928
00:43:49,873 --> 00:43:52,313
Or his... Johnson.

929
00:43:53,312 --> 00:43:54,272
Johnson?

930
00:43:54,392 --> 00:43:55,712
All right, Mr. Lebowski.

931
00:43:55,752 --> 00:43:57,351
Let's get down to cases.

932
00:43:57,391 --> 00:43:59,751
My father told me he agreed
to let you have the rug,

933
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:02,310
but as it was a gift
from me to my late mother,

934
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:03,350
it was not his to give.

935
00:44:04,829 --> 00:44:06,749
Your face.

936
00:44:06,789 --> 00:44:08,748
As for this kidnapping...

937
00:44:10,388 --> 00:44:11,668
Yes, I know all about it,

938
00:44:11,707 --> 00:44:13,267
And I know that
you acted as courier.

939
00:44:13,307 --> 00:44:14,707
Let me tell you something.

940
00:44:14,827 --> 00:44:16,306
The whole thing stinks
to high heaven.

941
00:44:17,826 --> 00:44:19,785
Right, but let me
explain something

942
00:44:19,785 --> 00:44:21,265
About the rug.

943
00:44:21,345 --> 00:44:23,744
Do you like sex,
Mr. Lebowski?

944
00:44:23,784 --> 00:44:24,784
Excuse me?

945
00:44:24,784 --> 00:44:27,183
Sex. The physical act
of love. Coitus.

946
00:44:27,223 --> 00:44:28,823
Do you like it?

947
00:44:28,863 --> 00:44:30,783
I was talking
about my rug.

948
00:44:30,822 --> 00:44:32,742
You're not interested
in sex?

949
00:44:32,782 --> 00:44:34,302
You mean coitus?

950
00:44:34,382 --> 00:44:35,181
I like it, too.

951
00:44:35,221 --> 00:44:37,301
It's a male myth
about feminists

952
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:38,261
That we hate sex.

953
00:44:38,341 --> 00:44:40,700
It can be a natural,
zesty enterprise.

954
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:42,259
However, there
are some people

955
00:44:42,299 --> 00:44:45,259
It is called satyriasis in men,
nymphomania in women

956
00:44:45,299 --> 00:44:48,218
who engage in it compulsively
and without joy.

957
00:44:49,298 --> 00:44:51,217
Oh, yes, Mr. Lebowski.

958
00:44:51,257 --> 00:44:53,816
These unfortunate souls
cannot love

959
00:44:53,896 --> 00:44:55,376
in the true sense
of the word.

960
00:44:55,416 --> 00:44:58,815
Our mutual acquaintance
Bunny is one of these.

961
00:44:58,855 --> 00:45:00,415
Listen, Maude,

962
00:45:00,455 --> 00:45:04,334
um, I'm sorry if your
stepmother is a nympho,

963
00:45:04,374 --> 00:45:05,933
but, you know,

964
00:45:05,973 --> 00:45:08,333
I don't see what this
has to do with...

965
00:45:08,333 --> 00:45:09,732
Do you have any Kahlua?

966
00:45:09,812 --> 00:45:11,732
Take' a look
at this, sir.

967
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:16,411
Oh, I know that guy.

968
00:45:17,850 --> 00:45:20,410
He's a nihilist.

969
00:45:37,885 --> 00:45:39,804
Hello. Meine dispatcher says

970
00:45:39,804 --> 00:45:41,764
there's something wrong
mitt deine kable.

971
00:45:41,844 --> 00:45:43,723
Yeah, come on in.
I'm not really sure

972
00:45:43,803 --> 00:45:45,803
exactly what's really
wrong with the cable.

973
00:45:45,883 --> 00:45:47,842
Zat's why they sent me.
I am an expert.

974
00:45:47,842 --> 00:45:49,242
The TV's in here.

975
00:45:49,322 --> 00:45:51,401
You recognize her,
of course.

976
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:57,280
Oh, that's
my friend Shari.

977
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,319
She just came over
to use the shower.

978
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:01,399
The story
is ludicrous.

979
00:46:01,439 --> 00:46:04,798
Meine nommen is Karl.
Ich bin expert.

980
00:46:04,838 --> 00:46:06,317
You must be here
to fix the cable.

981
00:46:06,397 --> 00:46:09,797
Lord, you can imagine
where it goes from here.

982
00:46:09,877 --> 00:46:11,276
He fixes the cable?

983
00:46:11,276 --> 00:46:12,756
Don't be fatuous,
Jeffrey.

984
00:46:12,756 --> 00:46:15,235
Little matter to me
that this woman chose

985
00:46:15,275 --> 00:46:16,755
to pursue a career
in pornography

986
00:46:16,795 --> 00:46:19,314
nor that she has been
"banging" Jackie Treehorn,

987
00:46:19,314 --> 00:46:21,234
to use the parlance
of our times,

988
00:46:21,274 --> 00:46:22,873
however,

989
00:46:22,913 --> 00:46:25,752
I am one of the 2 trustees
of the Lebowski Foundation,

990
00:46:25,792 --> 00:46:27,312
the other being my father.

991
00:46:27,352 --> 00:46:29,271
The Foundation takes
youngsters from watts and

992
00:46:29,311 --> 00:46:30,751
Shit, yeah,
the achievers.

993
00:46:30,831 --> 00:46:32,271
Little Lebowski
urban achievers, yes,

994
00:46:32,311 --> 00:46:34,310
and proud we are
of all of them,

995
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:37,309
I asked my father about
his withdrawal of $1 million

996
00:46:37,389 --> 00:46:38,389
from the Foundation account,

997
00:46:38,429 --> 00:46:40,349
and he told me
about this abduction.

998
00:46:40,389 --> 00:46:41,788
But I tell you,
it is preposterous.

999
00:46:41,828 --> 00:46:43,428
This compulsive fornicator

1000
00:46:43,468 --> 00:46:45,827
is taking my father
for the proverbial ride.

1001
00:46:45,867 --> 00:46:46,827
Yeah, but my

1002
00:46:46,867 --> 00:46:47,867
I'm getting to your rug.

1003
00:46:47,907 --> 00:46:49,826
My father and I
don't get along.

1004
00:46:49,866 --> 00:46:51,386
He doesn't approve
of my lifestyle,

1005
00:46:51,426 --> 00:46:53,425
and, needless to say,
I don't approve of his.

1006
00:46:53,465 --> 00:46:56,424
However, I hardly wish to make
my father's embezzlement

1007
00:46:56,464 --> 00:46:57,344
a police matter,

1008
00:46:57,384 --> 00:47:00,263
so I'm proposing that you
try to recover the money

1009
00:47:00,343 --> 00:47:01,823
from the people
you delivered it to.

1010
00:47:01,863 --> 00:47:05,222
Well,
I could do that.

1011
00:47:05,262 --> 00:47:08,341
If you successfully do so,
I will compensate you

1012
00:47:08,381 --> 00:47:12,980
to the tune of 10%
of the recovered sum.

1013
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:13,900
A hundred...

1014
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:16,379
Thousand. Yes.
Bones or clams

1015
00:47:16,459 --> 00:47:17,459
or whatever you call them.

1016
00:47:17,499 --> 00:47:19,978
Yeah, but...

1017
00:47:19,978 --> 00:47:21,458
What about my...

1018
00:47:21,498 --> 00:47:23,537
Your rug, yes.
well, with that money

1019
00:47:23,577 --> 00:47:24,937
you can buy
any number of rugs

1020
00:47:25,017 --> 00:47:26,856
That don't have
sentimental value for me.

1021
00:47:26,856 --> 00:47:29,856
And I am sorry about
that crack on the jaw.

1022
00:47:29,936 --> 00:47:32,815
Oh, th-that's fine.
That doesn't even...

1023
00:47:32,935 --> 00:47:33,895
Here's the name and number
of a doctor

1024
00:47:34,015 --> 00:47:35,974
who will look at it
for you.

1025
00:47:35,974 --> 00:47:36,814
You will receive no bill.

1026
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:38,373
He's a good man,
and thorough.

1027
00:47:38,453 --> 00:47:40,893
Th-that's thoughtful,
But

1028
00:47:40,973 --> 00:47:41,932
Please see him, Jeffrey.

1029
00:47:42,012 --> 00:47:43,972
He's a good man,
and thorough.

1030
00:47:43,972 --> 00:47:45,931
Oh, well...

1031
00:47:45,931 --> 00:47:47,531
All right.
All right.

1032
00:47:49,011 --> 00:47:50,410
So he says, "My wife's
a pain in the ass.

1033
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:52,490
She's always bustin'
my friggin' agates.

1034
00:47:52,490 --> 00:47:55,809
My daughter's married
to a real loser bastard,

1035
00:47:55,889 --> 00:47:58,328
and I got a rash
so bad on my ass

1036
00:47:58,328 --> 00:47:59,848
I can't even sit down.

1037
00:47:59,928 --> 00:48:02,927
But you know me, I can't
complain."

1038
00:48:02,927 --> 00:48:04,846
Ah, fuckin' a, man.
I got a rash, man.

1039
00:48:04,886 --> 00:48:06,966
Fuckin' a.

1040
00:48:07,966 --> 00:48:10,965
I gotta tell you,
Tone, man,

1041
00:48:10,965 --> 00:48:13,484
Earlier in the day, I was
really feeling shitty, man.

1042
00:48:13,524 --> 00:48:15,484
Really down
in the dumps.

1043
00:48:15,564 --> 00:48:17,003
Lost a little money...

1044
00:48:17,083 --> 00:48:20,042
Hey, you know what?
forget about it, huh?

1045
00:48:20,082 --> 00:48:21,042
Forget about it.

1046
00:48:21,122 --> 00:48:22,402
Yeah, fuck it, man.

1047
00:48:22,442 --> 00:48:23,881
I can't be worried
about that shit.

1048
00:48:23,961 --> 00:48:24,841
Life goes on, man.

1049
00:48:24,881 --> 00:48:27,401
Home, sweet home,
Mr. L.

1050
00:48:32,879 --> 00:48:34,359
Who's your friend
in the Volkswagen?

1051
00:48:36,438 --> 00:48:38,958
Yeah, he followed us
here.

1052
00:48:38,997 --> 00:48:40,917
When did he start foll

1053
00:48:40,957 --> 00:48:41,957
What the fuck?!

1054
00:48:41,997 --> 00:48:44,556
In the limo, you son
of a bitch. No arguing.

1055
00:48:44,556 --> 00:48:46,995
Hey, careful, man.
there's a beverage here.

1056
00:48:48,555 --> 00:48:50,355
Start talking

1057
00:48:50,395 --> 00:48:51,394
and talk fast,
you lousy bum.

1058
00:48:51,434 --> 00:48:53,354
We've been frantically
trying to reach you, Dude.

1059
00:48:53,394 --> 00:48:56,513
Where's my goddamn
money, you bum?!

1060
00:48:57,513 --> 00:48:58,832
Well, we...

1061
00:48:59,992 --> 00:49:00,952
They did not

1062
00:49:01,032 --> 00:49:02,991
receive the money,
you nitwit!

1063
00:49:03,031 --> 00:49:04,351
They did not receive
the money!

1064
00:49:04,431 --> 00:49:06,910
Her life
was in your hands!

1065
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:08,470
This is our concern,
Dude.

1066
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:11,029
No, man,
nothing is fucked here.

1067
00:49:11,069 --> 00:49:11,949
Nothing is fucked?!

1068
00:49:13,029 --> 00:49:14,028
The goddamn plane

1069
00:49:14,068 --> 00:49:16,548
Has crashed
into the mountain!

1070
00:49:16,588 --> 00:49:17,427
Look, man, come on.

1071
00:49:17,427 --> 00:49:20,907
Who are you gonna believe,
those guys or...

1072
00:49:20,907 --> 00:49:22,866
We dropped off
the damn money.

1073
00:49:22,906 --> 00:49:24,786
We?!

1074
00:49:26,425 --> 00:49:27,865
The royal we.

1075
00:49:27,865 --> 00:49:29,424
You know, the editorial.

1076
00:49:29,504 --> 00:49:31,904
I dropped off the money
exactly as per

1077
00:49:31,904 --> 00:49:35,383
Look. Man, I've got certain
information, all right?

1078
00:49:35,423 --> 00:49:38,382
Certain things have
come to light, and...

1079
00:49:38,462 --> 00:49:40,861
You know, has it
ever occurred to you

1080
00:49:40,981 --> 00:49:44,940
that instead of,
you know, running around,

1081
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:48,819
blaming me, given the
nature of all this new shit,

1082
00:49:48,899 --> 00:49:51,938
this could be
a lot more, ...

1083
00:49:52,018 --> 00:49:54,938
.. complex?

1084
00:49:55,018 --> 00:49:58,537
I mean, it might not be
just such a simple,

1085
00:49:58,617 --> 00:49:59,376
You know?

1086
00:49:59,536 --> 00:50:01,016
What in God's
holy name

1087
00:50:01,016 --> 00:50:02,936
Are you blathering
about?

1088
00:50:02,936 --> 00:50:05,975
Well, I'll tell you what
I'm blathering about.

1089
00:50:06,055 --> 00:50:07,454
I've got information, man.

1090
00:50:07,534 --> 00:50:09,494
New shit has come to light.

1091
00:50:09,494 --> 00:50:12,013
And ... shit, man...

1092
00:50:13,533 --> 00:50:16,092
She kidnapped herself.

1093
00:50:17,412 --> 00:50:20,011
Well, sure, man.

1094
00:50:20,091 --> 00:50:22,970
Look at it. You know,
a young trophy wife

1095
00:50:22,970 --> 00:50:25,050
In the parlance
of our times, you know

1096
00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:28,449
She .. owes
money all over town,

1097
00:50:28,449 --> 00:50:30,488
Including to known
pornographers.

1098
00:50:32,008 --> 00:50:35,007
And that's cool.
that-that's cool.

1099
00:50:35,007 --> 00:50:38,966
I'm saying,
she needs money, man.

1100
00:50:39,006 --> 00:50:40,526
And... you know,

1101
00:50:40,566 --> 00:50:42,885
of course they're gonna say
they didn't get it,

1102
00:50:42,925 --> 00:50:46,884
because
she wants more, man.

1103
00:50:46,924 --> 00:50:50,563
She's gotta feed the monkey.
I mean...

1104
00:50:51,883 --> 00:50:54,922
Hasn't that ever occurred
to you, man?

1105
00:50:58,441 --> 00:50:59,881
No, Mr. Lebowski,

1106
00:50:59,921 --> 00:51:02,000
it had not occurred
to me.

1107
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:04,040
That had not occurred
to us, Dude.

1108
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:05,999
Well, ok, you know,

1109
00:51:06,039 --> 00:51:08,518
you guys aren't privy
to all the new shit, so...

1110
00:51:08,558 --> 00:51:11,358
..you know. But...

1111
00:51:11,398 --> 00:51:15,117
..that's what you
that's what you pay me for.

1112
00:51:16,436 --> 00:51:19,395
Speaking of which,
do you think that you could,

1113
00:51:19,395 --> 00:51:21,955
give me my 20,000 in cash?

1114
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:24,914
My concern is..and I gotta
check with my accountant

1115
00:51:24,914 --> 00:51:27,473
but this might bump me
into a higher tax,

1116
00:51:27,513 --> 00:51:28,513
Brandt...

1117
00:51:28,553 --> 00:51:30,473
Give him
the envelope.

1118
00:51:30,513 --> 00:51:33,992
Oh, well, if you've already
got the check made out,

1119
00:51:33,992 --> 00:51:35,071
Th-that's cool.

1120
00:51:35,231 --> 00:51:37,711
We received this
this morning.

1121
00:51:39,150 --> 00:51:42,549
Since you have
failed to achieve,

1122
00:51:42,589 --> 00:51:46,108
even in the modest task
which was your charge,

1123
00:51:46,108 --> 00:51:50,027
since you have
stolen my money,

1124
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:53,587
since you have unrepentantly
betrayed my trust...

1125
00:51:53,707 --> 00:51:55,066
I have no choice

1126
00:51:55,066 --> 00:52:00,145
but to tell these bums to do
whatever is necessary

1127
00:52:00,225 --> 00:52:04,144
to recover their money
from you, Jeffrey Lebowski.

1128
00:52:04,144 --> 00:52:07,023
And with Brandt
as my witness,

1129
00:52:07,103 --> 00:52:08,503
I will tell you this:

1130
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:12,542
Any further harm
visited upon Bunny

1131
00:52:12,622 --> 00:52:17,540
will be visited tenfold
upon your head.

1132
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:24,578
By god, sir, I will not
abide another toe.

1133
00:52:30,257 --> 00:52:33,736
That wasn't her toe, Dude.

1134
00:52:33,816 --> 00:52:35,496
Whose toe was it,
Walter?

1135
00:52:35,576 --> 00:52:36,535
How the fuck should I know?

1136
00:52:36,615 --> 00:52:39,015
I do know that nothing
about it indicates

1137
00:52:39,055 --> 00:52:40,574
Man, the nail
polish, Walter.

1138
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:42,054
Fine, Dude.

1139
00:52:42,134 --> 00:52:44,053
As if it's impossible
to get some nail polish,

1140
00:52:44,093 --> 00:52:45,533
Apply it
To someone else's toe.

1141
00:52:45,613 --> 00:52:47,093
Someone else's

1142
00:52:47,093 --> 00:52:49,012
Where the fuck
are they gonna get

1143
00:52:49,052 --> 00:52:51,011
You want a toe?
I can get you a toe.

1144
00:52:51,091 --> 00:52:53,491
Believe me,
there are ways, Dude.

1145
00:52:53,571 --> 00:52:55,530
You don't wanna know
about it, believe me.

1146
00:52:55,610 --> 00:52:57,650
Hell, I can get you a toe
by 3:00 this afternoon,

1147
00:52:57,690 --> 00:52:58,530
with nail polish.

1148
00:52:58,570 --> 00:53:00,609
These fuckin' amateurs.

1149
00:53:01,729 --> 00:53:03,168
They send us a toe,

1150
00:53:03,208 --> 00:53:04,568
we're supposed to shit
ourselves with fear.

1151
00:53:05,688 --> 00:53:06,567
Now, the point is

1152
00:53:06,607 --> 00:53:08,127
They're gonna kill her,
Walter,

1153
00:53:08,167 --> 00:53:10,166
And then they're gonna
kill me.

1154
00:53:10,206 --> 00:53:12,126
Dude...

1155
00:53:12,166 --> 00:53:13,606
That's...

1156
00:53:13,646 --> 00:53:15,645
That's just the stress
talking, man.

1157
00:53:15,725 --> 00:53:18,684
Now so far we have
what appears to me

1158
00:53:18,724 --> 00:53:21,204
To be a series of
victimless crimes.

1159
00:53:21,244 --> 00:53:22,123
What about the toe?

1160
00:53:22,123 --> 00:53:23,643
Forget about
the fucking toe!

1161
00:53:23,723 --> 00:53:25,682
Excuse me, sir,

1162
00:53:25,722 --> 00:53:27,042
Could you please
keep your voices down?

1163
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:28,682
This is a family restaurant.

1164
00:53:28,682 --> 00:53:30,001
Oh, please, dear.

1165
00:53:30,041 --> 00:53:32,081
For your information,
the supreme court

1166
00:53:32,121 --> 00:53:34,640
has roundly rejected
prior restraint!

1167
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:36,600
Walter, this is not
a first amendment thing.

1168
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,039
If you don't calm down,

1169
00:53:38,039 --> 00:53:39,599
I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave.

1170
00:53:39,679 --> 00:53:42,998
Lady, I got buddies who
died face down in the muck

1171
00:53:43,118 --> 00:53:46,117
so you and I could enjoy
this family restaurant!

1172
00:53:46,157 --> 00:53:47,637
All right,
I'm outta here.

1173
00:53:47,677 --> 00:53:49,116
Hey, Dude,
don't go away, man.

1174
00:53:49,116 --> 00:53:51,076
Come on, this affects
all of us, man.

1175
00:53:51,156 --> 00:53:53,515
Our basic freedoms!

1176
00:53:58,114 --> 00:53:59,114
I'm stayin'.

1177
00:54:01,153 --> 00:54:03,712
I'm finishing my coffee.

1178
00:54:08,151 --> 00:54:10,231
Enjoying my coffee.

1179
00:54:25,627 --> 00:54:28,626
: The Dude is not in.

1180
00:54:28,626 --> 00:54:30,585
: Leave a message
after the beep.

1181
00:54:30,665 --> 00:54:32,065
: Thanks, man.

1182
00:54:33,105 --> 00:54:35,184
Mr. Lebowski, this is
duty officer Rolvaag

1183
00:54:35,184 --> 00:54:36,664
of the LAPD.

1184
00:54:36,664 --> 00:54:38,183
We've recovered
your automobile.

1185
00:54:38,263 --> 00:54:40,583
It can be claimed at the
North Hollywood auto circus

1186
00:54:40,703 --> 00:54:41,543
there on Victory.

1187
00:54:41,623 --> 00:54:43,062
Far out, man.

1188
00:54:43,102 --> 00:54:44,742
Far fucking out!

1189
00:54:55,619 --> 00:54:58,298
This is a private
residence, man.

1190
00:55:06,216 --> 00:55:09,335
Ah, nice marmot.

1191
00:55:18,173 --> 00:55:23,012
Ve vant the money,
Lebowski.

1192
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:30,130
You think
ve are kidding

1193
00:55:30,170 --> 00:55:32,089
Or making with
the funny stuff?

1194
00:55:32,129 --> 00:55:33,129
There are things

1195
00:55:33,169 --> 00:55:35,089
you haven't dreamed of,
Lebowski.

1196
00:55:35,129 --> 00:55:36,128
Ja. Ve believe
in nothing.

1197
00:55:36,168 --> 00:55:38,088
He believes in nothing,
Lebowski, nothing.

1198
00:55:38,128 --> 00:55:39,607
and tomorrow
ve come back

1199
00:55:39,647 --> 00:55:40,647
and ve cut off
your chonson.

1200
00:55:40,687 --> 00:55:42,087
Excuse me?

1201
00:55:42,087 --> 00:55:43,646
I said we'll cut off
Your Johnson!

1202
00:55:43,726 --> 00:55:46,166
Just think about that,
Lebowski.

1203
00:55:46,206 --> 00:55:49,285
Ja, your viggly penis,
Lebowski.

1204
00:55:49,325 --> 00:55:53,404
Ja, and maybe we stomp on it
and sqoosh it, Lebowski.

1205
00:56:00,162 --> 00:56:02,681
It was discovered
last night in Van Nuys

1206
00:56:02,721 --> 00:56:05,241
lodged against
an abutment.

1207
00:56:05,281 --> 00:56:06,280
Oh, man, lodged where?

1208
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:08,240
You're lucky she
didn't get chopped,

1209
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:09,280
Mr. Lebowski.

1210
00:56:10,399 --> 00:56:11,799
Must've been
a joyride situation.

1211
00:56:11,879 --> 00:56:13,279
They abandoned
the vehicle

1212
00:56:13,279 --> 00:56:14,318
once they hit
the retaining wall.

1213
00:56:14,318 --> 00:56:16,318
Oh, my
fucking briefcase!

1214
00:56:16,398 --> 00:56:18,237
Man, it's not here.
Shit!

1215
00:56:18,357 --> 00:56:19,277
Yeah, I saw that
on the report. Sorry.

1216
00:56:19,277 --> 00:56:22,276
You gotta get in
on the other side.

1217
00:56:22,276 --> 00:56:25,235
The side-view was
found on the road

1218
00:56:25,355 --> 00:56:27,755
by the car.

1219
00:56:27,755 --> 00:56:29,714
You're lucky they left
the tape deck, though,

1220
00:56:29,794 --> 00:56:31,754
And the Creedence.

1221
00:56:31,754 --> 00:56:35,233
Aw, Jesus!
What's that smell, man?

1222
00:56:35,313 --> 00:56:37,272
Probably a vagrant
slept in the car

1223
00:56:37,272 --> 00:56:40,271
or maybe just used it
as a toilet and moved on.

1224
00:56:42,831 --> 00:56:45,230
Are you gonna find
these guys or, you know,

1225
00:56:45,310 --> 00:56:48,829
I mean, you got any
promising, uh, leads or...

1226
00:56:48,909 --> 00:56:50,229
Leads?

1227
00:56:50,269 --> 00:56:52,828
Yeah. Sure.

1228
00:56:52,828 --> 00:56:54,908
I'll just check
with the boys

1229
00:56:54,908 --> 00:56:55,747
down at
the crime lab.

1230
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:58,347
They, got
4 more detectives

1231
00:56:58,347 --> 00:56:59,826
Working on the case.

1232
00:56:59,946 --> 00:57:02,346
They got us
working in shifts.

1233
00:57:06,904 --> 00:57:08,824
Leads.

1234
00:57:08,864 --> 00:57:12,383
My only hope is that
the big Lebowski kills me

1235
00:57:12,463 --> 00:57:14,303
Before the Germans
can cut my dick off.

1236
00:57:14,303 --> 00:57:16,222
Now, that is just
ridiculous, Dude.

1237
00:57:16,262 --> 00:57:17,662
No one's going to
cut your dick off.

1238
00:57:17,702 --> 00:57:19,141
Thank you, Walter.

1239
00:57:19,181 --> 00:57:20,661
Not if I have anything
to say about it.

1240
00:57:20,701 --> 00:57:21,661
Thank you, Walter.

1241
00:57:21,741 --> 00:57:23,780
That makes me feel
very secure.

1242
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:24,740
Dude.

1243
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:26,299
That makes me feel
very warm inside.

1244
00:57:26,379 --> 00:57:27,259
Now, Dude.

1245
00:57:27,339 --> 00:57:29,778
This whole
fuckin' thing.

1246
00:57:29,818 --> 00:57:30,818
I could be sitting here

1247
00:57:30,858 --> 00:57:33,298
with just pee stains
on my rug.

1248
00:57:33,338 --> 00:57:34,337
Yeah.

1249
00:57:34,377 --> 00:57:35,857
But, no, man,
I gotta, you know.

1250
00:57:35,897 --> 00:57:36,897
Fucking Germans.

1251
00:57:36,937 --> 00:57:38,856
Nothing changes.

1252
00:57:38,896 --> 00:57:40,816
Fucking Nazis.

1253
00:57:40,856 --> 00:57:41,815
They were Nazis, Dude?

1254
00:57:41,855 --> 00:57:43,175
Oh, come on, Donny.

1255
00:57:43,295 --> 00:57:45,254
They were threatening
castration.

1256
00:57:45,294 --> 00:57:46,774
Are we gonna
split hairs here?

1257
00:57:47,854 --> 00:57:48,694
Am I wrong?

1258
00:57:48,814 --> 00:57:49,733
Well, he..

1259
00:57:49,853 --> 00:57:51,253
They were
nihilists, man.

1260
00:57:52,333 --> 00:57:54,252
They kept saying
they believed in nothing.

1261
00:57:54,332 --> 00:57:56,412
Nihilists.

1262
00:57:57,371 --> 00:57:58,891
Fuck me.

1263
00:58:00,370 --> 00:58:01,250
I mean,
say what you want

1264
00:58:01,330 --> 00:58:02,850
about the tenets

1265
00:58:02,850 --> 00:58:03,770
of national
Socialism, Dude.

1266
00:58:03,810 --> 00:58:05,369
At least
it's an ethos.

1267
00:58:05,409 --> 00:58:07,329
And also,
let's not forget

1268
00:58:07,329 --> 00:58:08,848
Let’s not forget,
Dude

1269
00:58:08,928 --> 00:58:10,768
That keeping
wildlife, um,

1270
00:58:10,768 --> 00:58:12,247
an amphibious rodent

1271
00:58:12,247 --> 00:58:14,687
for, um, you know,
domestic...

1272
00:58:14,767 --> 00:58:17,766
Within the city...

1273
00:58:17,766 --> 00:58:19,246
That ain't legal
either.

1274
00:58:19,405 --> 00:58:21,205
What are you,
a fucking park ranger now?

1275
00:58:21,325 --> 00:58:23,284
No, I'm
just trying

1276
00:58:23,284 --> 00:58:25,804
Who gives a shit
about the fucking marmot?

1277
00:58:25,804 --> 00:58:27,763
We are sympathizing
here, Dude.

1278
00:58:27,763 --> 00:58:28,843
Fuck sympathy.

1279
00:58:28,923 --> 00:58:31,362
I don't need your
fucking sympathy, man.

1280
00:58:31,442 --> 00:58:33,882
I need my
fucking Johnson.

1281
00:58:34,002 --> 00:58:35,361
What do you need
that for, Dude?

1282
00:58:35,361 --> 00:58:36,921
You have got to
buck up, man!

1283
00:58:37,001 --> 00:58:38,800
You cannot drag
this negative energy

1284
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:40,320
Into the tournament.

1285
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,959
Fuck the tournament.
Fuck you, Walter.

1286
00:58:44,959 --> 00:58:47,519
Fuck the tournament?

1287
00:58:47,519 --> 00:58:48,879
Ok, Dude. I can see

1288
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:49,919
you don't want to be
cheered up here.

1289
00:58:49,999 --> 00:58:50,919
Come on, Donny.

1290
00:58:50,919 --> 00:58:52,399
Let's go get us
a lane.

1291
00:58:57,479 --> 00:58:59,439
Another Caucasian, Gary.

1292
00:58:59,519 --> 00:59:00,959
Right, Dude.

1293
00:59:02,519 --> 00:59:04,479
Friends like these,
huh, Gary?

1294
00:59:04,479 --> 00:59:06,439
That's right, Dude.

1295
00:59:29,558 --> 00:59:31,958
Do you have
A good sarsaparilla?

1296
00:59:32,038 --> 00:59:34,438
Sioux city sarsaparilla?

1297
00:59:34,478 --> 00:59:36,998
Yeah. That's a good one.

1298
00:59:39,438 --> 00:59:41,318
How you doin'
there, Dude?

1299
00:59:41,398 --> 00:59:43,878
Not too good, man.

1300
00:59:43,918 --> 00:59:45,958
One of those days, huh?

1301
00:59:47,998 --> 00:59:48,918
Well...

1302
00:59:48,958 --> 00:59:52,958
A wiser fella than myself
once said,

1303
00:59:52,998 --> 00:59:55,958
"Sometimes you eat
the bar and"

1304
00:59:55,998 --> 00:59:58,038
Much obliged.

1305
00:59:58,078 --> 01:00:01,478
"And sometimes
the bar, well...

1306
01:00:01,518 --> 01:00:02,958
He eats you."

1307
01:00:02,998 --> 01:00:06,398
That some kind
of eastern thing?

1308
01:00:06,438 --> 01:00:08,518
Far from it.

1309
01:00:14,598 --> 01:00:17,558
I like your style,
Dude.

1310
01:00:17,558 --> 01:00:19,518
Well...

1311
01:00:19,598 --> 01:00:22,038
I dig your style, too,
man.

1312
01:00:22,038 --> 01:00:25,118
You got
a whole cowboy thing going.

1313
01:00:30,038 --> 01:00:32,598
There's just one thing,
Dude.

1314
01:00:32,598 --> 01:00:33,998
And what's that?

1315
01:00:34,078 --> 01:00:37,718
Do you have to use
so many cuss words?

1316
01:00:40,078 --> 01:00:42,158
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1317
01:00:45,117 --> 01:00:48,117
Have it your way.

1318
01:00:58,557 --> 01:01:00,637
Call for you, Dude.

1319
01:01:05,157 --> 01:01:08,037
Jeffrey, you have
not gone to the doctor.

1320
01:01:08,117 --> 01:01:11,077
..no, I haven't yet.

1321
01:01:12,157 --> 01:01:14,637
I'd like to see you
immediately.

1322
01:01:29,137 --> 01:01:31,657
So you're Lebowski.

1323
01:01:35,457 --> 01:01:37,697
Maude has told me
all about you.

1324
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:39,777
She'll be back
in a minute. Sit down.

1325
01:01:39,857 --> 01:01:41,697
Do you want a drink?

1326
01:01:41,697 --> 01:01:44,177
Yeah, sure.
White Russian.

1327
01:01:44,217 --> 01:01:46,297
The bar's over there.

1328
01:01:50,817 --> 01:01:53,577
So what do you do,
Lebowski?

1329
01:01:53,657 --> 01:01:55,737
Who the fuck are you,
man?

1330
01:01:56,777 --> 01:01:58,657
Just a friend
of Maudie's.

1331
01:01:58,657 --> 01:02:00,657
Yeah, the friend
with the cleft asshole?

1332
01:02:02,737 --> 01:02:05,217
What do you do?

1333
01:02:05,257 --> 01:02:07,176
Oh, nothing much.

1334
01:02:09,736 --> 01:02:11,176
Yeah, how are you?

1335
01:02:11,216 --> 01:02:12,096
Listen, Maude,

1336
01:02:12,136 --> 01:02:15,296
I got to, ...

1337
01:02:16,696 --> 01:02:19,696
Tender my resignation
or whatever,

1338
01:02:19,696 --> 01:02:22,256
Because, ...it
looks like your mother

1339
01:02:22,256 --> 01:02:24,216
really was kidnapped
after all.

1340
01:02:24,256 --> 01:02:27,176
She most certainly
was not.

1341
01:02:27,296 --> 01:02:30,256
Hey, man, why
don't you fucking...

1342
01:02:30,256 --> 01:02:31,736
Listen occasionally?

1343
01:02:31,816 --> 01:02:32,696
You might
learn something.

1344
01:02:34,776 --> 01:02:36,296
Please don't call her
my mother.

1345
01:02:37,296 --> 01:02:38,696
She's most definitely
the perpetrator

1346
01:02:38,736 --> 01:02:40,256
and not the victim.

1347
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:43,256
I'm telling you, I got
pretty definitive evidence

1348
01:02:43,336 --> 01:02:44,176
From who?

1349
01:02:44,256 --> 01:02:45,816
From the main guy--
Oolie.

1350
01:02:45,816 --> 01:02:47,256
Oolie Coco?

1351
01:02:47,256 --> 01:02:49,216
Her co-star in
the beaver picture?

1352
01:02:49,216 --> 01:02:52,096
Beaver?
you mean vagina

1353
01:02:52,176 --> 01:02:54,616
I mean,
you know the guy?

1354
01:02:54,696 --> 01:02:56,656
I might have introduced them
for all I know.

1355
01:02:56,656 --> 01:02:58,656
Do you remember Oolie?

1356
01:02:59,656 --> 01:03:02,216
He's a musician. Used
to have a group Autobahn.

1357
01:03:02,216 --> 01:03:03,696
Look in my LP's.

1358
01:03:03,776 --> 01:03:06,656
They released one album
in the late seventies.

1359
01:03:06,776 --> 01:03:09,776
Their music is sort of
a technopop.

1360
01:03:09,776 --> 01:03:12,256
So he's pretending to be
the abductor?

1361
01:03:12,336 --> 01:03:13,256
Well, yeah.

1362
01:03:13,256 --> 01:03:16,256
Look, Jeffrey, you don't
really kidnap someone

1363
01:03:16,256 --> 01:03:17,296
you're acquainted with.

1364
01:03:17,296 --> 01:03:18,096
The whole idea

1365
01:03:18,136 --> 01:03:19,656
is that the hostage can't
be able to identify you

1366
01:03:19,696 --> 01:03:21,256
after you've let them go.

1367
01:03:21,256 --> 01:03:22,776
I know that.

1368
01:03:26,215 --> 01:03:28,775
What the fuck
is with this guy?

1369
01:03:28,775 --> 01:03:30,255
Who is he?

1370
01:03:30,415 --> 01:03:31,255
Knox Harrington.

1371
01:03:31,255 --> 01:03:32,775
The video artist.

1372
01:03:34,215 --> 01:03:35,775
So Oolie
has the money?

1373
01:03:35,775 --> 01:03:37,175
Well...

1374
01:03:37,255 --> 01:03:39,695
..no, not exactly.

1375
01:03:40,815 --> 01:03:43,375
This is a very
complicated case, Maude.

1376
01:03:44,255 --> 01:03:45,215
A lot of ins,
a lot of outs,

1377
01:03:45,295 --> 01:03:47,695
a lot of what-have-yous,
and,

1378
01:03:47,735 --> 01:03:49,735
a lot of strands
to keep in my head, man.

1379
01:03:49,775 --> 01:03:51,815
A lot of strands
in old Duder's head.

1380
01:03:52,775 --> 01:03:54,255
If Oolie doesn't have it,
then who does?

1381
01:03:54,295 --> 01:03:57,255
It's Sandra,
about the Bearnali.

1382
01:03:57,255 --> 01:03:58,775
..look,
I have to take this.

1383
01:03:58,855 --> 01:04:00,775
Do you still have
that doctor's number?

1384
01:04:00,815 --> 01:04:02,735
No, really. It's
not even bruised anymore.

1385
01:04:02,775 --> 01:04:04,335
Oh, please, Jeffrey,

1386
01:04:04,375 --> 01:04:05,255
I don't want
to be responsible

1387
01:04:05,295 --> 01:04:07,375
For any delayed
after-effects.

1388
01:04:08,855 --> 01:04:09,855
After-effects?

1389
01:04:40,335 --> 01:04:42,135
Could you slide
your shorts down,

1390
01:04:42,175 --> 01:04:43,935
Mr. Lebowski, please?

1391
01:04:45,694 --> 01:04:47,654
No. No, man.
She hit me right here.

1392
01:04:47,694 --> 01:04:49,254
I understand.

1393
01:04:49,254 --> 01:04:51,934
Could you slide
your shorts down, please?

1394
01:05:02,534 --> 01:05:04,934
# Just got home
from Illinois #

1395
01:05:05,014 --> 01:05:07,494

01:05:37,454 --> 01:05:38,814

01:07:23,413 --> 01:07:25,012
He lives
in north Hollywood,

1424
01:07:25,052 --> 01:07:27,492
on Radford, near
the in-n-out burger.

1425
01:07:27,572 --> 01:07:29,012
The in-n-out burger's
on Camrose.

1426
01:07:29,012 --> 01:07:30,452
Near
the in-n-out burger.

1427
01:07:30,452 --> 01:07:32,412
Those are good burgers,
Walter.

1428
01:07:32,412 --> 01:07:33,932
Shut the fuck up,
Donny.

1429
01:07:33,932 --> 01:07:34,972
The kid is in
ninth grade, Dude,

1430
01:07:34,972 --> 01:07:37,972
And his father is
Are you ready for this?

1431
01:07:37,972 --> 01:07:40,532
His father is
Arthur Digby Sellers.

1432
01:07:40,572 --> 01:07:42,572
Who the fuck is that?

1433
01:07:43,612 --> 01:07:45,452
Who the fuck is
Arthur Digby Sellers?

1434
01:07:45,532 --> 01:07:48,492
Ever heard of a little show
called branded, Dude?

1435
01:07:48,532 --> 01:07:49,452
Yes, I know

1436
01:07:49,452 --> 01:07:51,532
All but one man died
there at bitter creek?

1437
01:07:51,532 --> 01:07:54,492
I know the fucking show,
Walter. So what?

1438
01:07:54,532 --> 01:07:57,332
Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers
wrote 156 episodes, Dude.

1439
01:07:58,412 --> 01:07:59,892
The bulk
of the series.

1440
01:08:00,932 --> 01:08:02,372
Not exactly
a lightweight.

1441
01:08:03,452 --> 01:08:05,892
And yet his son
is a fucking dunce.

1442
01:08:07,492 --> 01:08:10,412
Anyway, we'll go there
after the what-have-you,

1443
01:08:10,452 --> 01:08:12,052
we'll brace the kid,
should be a pushover.

1444
01:08:12,092 --> 01:08:13,572
We'll be near
the in-n-out burger.

1445
01:08:13,612 --> 01:08:16,572
Shut the fuck up,
Donny!

1446
01:08:16,612 --> 01:08:18,492
We'll go out there,
we'll brace the kid,

1447
01:08:18,572 --> 01:08:20,612
He should be a pushover.

1448
01:08:20,652 --> 01:08:22,532
We'll get that fucking
$1 million back

1449
01:08:22,572 --> 01:08:25,052
If he hasn't spent it
already.

1450
01:08:25,092 --> 01:08:26,412
A million fucking clams.

1451
01:08:26,452 --> 01:08:28,932
And yes, we'll be near
the ..

1452
01:08:28,972 --> 01:08:30,532
In-n-out.

1453
01:08:31,492 --> 01:08:32,492
Some burgers,

1454
01:08:32,532 --> 01:08:33,532
some beers,

1455
01:08:33,572 --> 01:08:34,492
a few laughs.

1456
01:08:36,572 --> 01:08:40,172
Our fucking troubles
are over, Dude.

1457
01:08:51,611 --> 01:08:54,451
Oh, fuck me, man!

1458
01:08:54,531 --> 01:08:57,891
That kid's already spent
all the money, man!

1459
01:08:57,971 --> 01:08:59,531
New 'vette?
Hardly, Dude.

1460
01:08:59,531 --> 01:09:04,491
I'd say he still has
960, $970,000 left,

1461
01:09:04,571 --> 01:09:06,531
depending on the options.

1462
01:09:06,531 --> 01:09:07,571
Wait in the car, Donny.

1463
01:09:10,811 --> 01:09:11,731
Yes?

1464
01:09:11,731 --> 01:09:13,211
Pilar?

1465
01:09:14,731 --> 01:09:16,211
My name
is Walter Sobchak.

1466
01:09:16,211 --> 01:09:19,211
This is my associate
Jeffrey Lebowski.

1467
01:09:19,211 --> 01:09:21,571
Um, we came to talk
about little Larry.

1468
01:09:21,571 --> 01:09:23,131
May we come in?

1469
01:09:23,211 --> 01:09:24,571
Yes, yes.

1470
01:09:24,651 --> 01:09:25,571
Thank you.

1471
01:09:30,251 --> 01:09:31,891
That's him, Dude.

1472
01:09:39,331 --> 01:09:41,851
And a good day to you,
Sir!

1473
01:09:41,851 --> 01:09:44,531
..sit down, please.

1474
01:09:49,331 --> 01:09:52,291
Larry, sweetie,
that man is here!

1475
01:09:52,331 --> 01:09:53,691
Is he...

1476
01:09:53,771 --> 01:09:55,331
Does he still write?

1477
01:09:56,771 --> 01:09:58,731
He has health problems.

1478
01:10:01,251 --> 01:10:03,731
Sir, I just
want to say ...

1479
01:10:03,771 --> 01:10:05,290
that we're both..

1480
01:10:05,290 --> 01:10:07,370
on a personal level...

1481
01:10:07,370 --> 01:10:10,370
Really enormous fans.

1482
01:10:10,450 --> 01:10:13,850
Branded, especially
the early episodes,

1483
01:10:13,930 --> 01:10:15,930
was truly a source
of inspiration

1484
01:10:16,010 --> 01:10:17,250
Sweetie, sit down!

1485
01:10:17,330 --> 01:10:18,290
This man
is the police.

1486
01:10:19,410 --> 01:10:20,810
we didn't want
to give the impression

1487
01:10:20,850 --> 01:10:21,850
that we were police
exactly.

1488
01:10:21,890 --> 01:10:23,890
We're hoping
it won't be necessary

1489
01:10:23,930 --> 01:10:24,770
to call the police.

1490
01:10:24,850 --> 01:10:27,770
But that's up
to little Larry here.

1491
01:10:27,810 --> 01:10:29,330
Isn't it, Larry?

1492
01:10:39,890 --> 01:10:42,450
Is this your homework,
Larry?

1493
01:10:43,370 --> 01:10:45,370
Is this your homework,
Larry?

1494
01:10:45,410 --> 01:10:46,290
Look, man

1495
01:10:46,290 --> 01:10:47,330
Dude, please.

1496
01:10:47,330 --> 01:10:49,250
Is this your homework,
Larry?

1497
01:10:49,290 --> 01:10:51,210
Just ask him
about the car, man.

1498
01:10:51,290 --> 01:10:52,250
Is this yours, Larry?

1499
01:10:52,330 --> 01:10:53,770
Is this your homework,
Larry?

1500
01:10:53,770 --> 01:10:55,370
Is that your car
out front?

1501
01:10:55,410 --> 01:10:56,210
Is this your homework,
Larry?

1502
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:57,810
We know it's
his fucking homework!

1503
01:10:57,890 --> 01:11:00,250
Where's the fucking money,
you little brat?

1504
01:11:00,330 --> 01:11:02,330
Look, Larry...

1505
01:11:02,330 --> 01:11:03,370
Have you ever heard
of Vietnam?

1506
01:11:03,370 --> 01:11:05,290
You're entering
a world of pain, son.

1507
01:11:05,290 --> 01:11:06,890
we know that this is
your homework.

1508
01:11:06,930 --> 01:11:08,370
We know that you stole
the car.

1509
01:11:08,370 --> 01:11:09,850
And the fucking money!

1510
01:11:09,850 --> 01:11:11,370
And the fucking money.

1511
01:11:11,450 --> 01:11:12,850
And we know that this
is your homework.

1512
01:11:12,890 --> 01:11:14,290
We're gonna cut
your dick off, Larry.

1513
01:11:14,290 --> 01:11:16,930
You're killing
your father, Larry.

1514
01:11:18,770 --> 01:11:20,290
All right.

1515
01:11:20,290 --> 01:11:21,770
This is pointless.

1516
01:11:23,290 --> 01:11:26,329
It's time for plan "b."

1517
01:11:27,369 --> 01:11:31,289
You might want to watch out
that front window, Larry.

1518
01:11:31,289 --> 01:11:33,369
Son, this is what happens

1519
01:11:33,369 --> 01:11:35,929
when you fuck a stranger
in the ass!

1520
01:11:37,529 --> 01:11:38,929
Little language problem
here.

1521
01:11:38,929 --> 01:11:42,329
The little prick's
stonewalling me.

1522
01:11:44,409 --> 01:11:46,369
What...are you doing,
man?

1523
01:11:48,929 --> 01:11:50,969
What are you doing?

1524
01:11:51,849 --> 01:11:53,449
Here you go, Larry.

1525
01:11:53,449 --> 01:11:55,809
You see what happens?

1526
01:11:55,889 --> 01:11:58,769
You see what happens,
Larry?

1527
01:11:58,889 --> 01:12:00,849
You see what happens?

1528
01:12:00,969 --> 01:12:02,369
This is what happens

1529
01:12:02,449 --> 01:12:04,369
when you fuck a stranger
in the ass, Larry!

1530
01:12:07,009 --> 01:12:08,929
This is what happens,
Larry!

1531
01:12:08,969 --> 01:12:10,889
You see what happens,
Larry?

1532
01:12:10,889 --> 01:12:12,329
You see what happens

1533
01:12:12,449 --> 01:12:13,849
when you fuck a stranger
in the ass?

1534
01:12:13,889 --> 01:12:15,329
This is what happens.

1535
01:12:15,329 --> 01:12:17,409
You see what happens,
Larry?

1536
01:12:18,289 --> 01:12:19,249
You see what happens,
Larry?

1537
01:12:19,329 --> 01:12:21,929
Do you see what happens,
Larry,

1538
01:12:21,929 --> 01:12:24,449
when you fuck a stranger
in the ass?

1539
01:12:25,449 --> 01:12:29,329
This is what happens,
Larry!

1540
01:12:29,489 --> 01:12:30,369
No!

1541
01:12:30,529 --> 01:12:31,769
This is what happens,
Larry!

1542
01:12:31,849 --> 01:12:32,809
This is what happens

1543
01:12:32,889 --> 01:12:34,449
when you fuck a stranger

1544
01:12:34,449 --> 01:12:35,929
What the fuck
are you doing, man?!

1545
01:12:35,929 --> 01:12:36,889
Stop it!

1546
01:12:36,929 --> 01:12:39,329
I just bought
that fucking car last week!

1547
01:12:39,329 --> 01:12:40,369
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

1548
01:12:40,369 --> 01:12:41,769
I'm gonna
fuckin' kill you!

1549
01:12:41,809 --> 01:12:44,808
I just bought
the fucking car last week!

1550
01:12:44,848 --> 01:12:47,328
I'll kill your
fucking car, man!

1551
01:12:47,408 --> 01:12:49,448
No! No! Hey! Hey!
That's not his hey!

1552
01:12:49,488 --> 01:12:50,768
God damn it!

1553
01:12:53,928 --> 01:12:55,328
You like that?

1554
01:12:56,928 --> 01:13:02,688
I kill your fucking car!

1555
01:13:22,968 --> 01:13:24,408
I accept your apology.

1556
01:13:24,488 --> 01:13:27,488
No. I just..

1557
01:13:27,488 --> 01:13:30,488
Want to handle it
by myself from now on.

1558
01:13:32,528 --> 01:13:35,888
That has nothing
to do with it.

1559
01:13:35,968 --> 01:13:37,928
Yes, the car made it home.

1560
01:13:37,928 --> 01:13:40,368
You're calling me at home.

1561
01:13:41,968 --> 01:13:44,448
it did not look like...

1562
01:13:44,448 --> 01:13:46,888
Larry was about to crack.

1563
01:13:46,968 --> 01:13:50,008
Well,
that's your perception.

1564
01:13:50,928 --> 01:13:53,928
You know, Walter,
you're right.

1565
01:13:54,008 --> 01:13:56,408
There is
an unspoken message here.

1566
01:13:56,528 --> 01:13:57,448
It's fuck you!

1567
01:13:57,568 --> 01:13:59,528
Leave me the fuck alone!

1568
01:14:01,488 --> 01:14:04,607
Yeah, I'll be at practice.

1569
01:14:22,087 --> 01:14:22,967
Pin your diapers on,
Lebowski.

1570
01:14:23,127 --> 01:14:25,007
Jackie Treehorn
wants to see you.

1571
01:14:25,007 --> 01:14:28,567
Jackie Treehorn knows
which Lebowski you are.

1572
01:14:28,607 --> 01:14:30,967
Jackie Treehorn wants to see
the deadbeat Lebowski.

1573
01:14:31,007 --> 01:14:33,727
You're not dealing
with morons here.

1574
01:15:20,647 --> 01:15:22,167
Hello, Dude.

1575
01:15:22,167 --> 01:15:23,647
Thanks for coming.

1576
01:15:23,686 --> 01:15:25,566
I'm Jackie Treehorn.

1577
01:15:27,606 --> 01:15:31,126
This is quite a pad
you got here, man.

1578
01:15:31,166 --> 01:15:33,086
Completely unspoiled.

1579
01:15:33,166 --> 01:15:35,166
What's your drink, Dude?

1580
01:15:35,246 --> 01:15:37,206
White Russian.
Thanks.

1581
01:15:37,246 --> 01:15:39,486
White Russian.

1582
01:15:39,486 --> 01:15:41,646
How's the smut business,
Jackie?

1583
01:15:41,646 --> 01:15:43,646
I wouldn't know,
Dude.

1584
01:15:43,646 --> 01:15:45,766
I deal in publishing,

1585
01:15:45,766 --> 01:15:46,646
entertainment,

1586
01:15:46,766 --> 01:15:48,886
political advocacy.

1587
01:15:48,886 --> 01:15:50,326
Oh. Which one's
Logjamming?

1588
01:15:50,326 --> 01:15:52,286
Yes, regrettably,
it's true.

1589
01:15:52,286 --> 01:15:55,126
Standards have fallen
in adult entertainment.

1590
01:15:55,206 --> 01:15:56,646
It's video, Dude.

1591
01:15:56,726 --> 01:15:59,286
Now that we're competing
with those amateurs,

1592
01:15:59,286 --> 01:16:03,206
We can't afford to invest
in little extras, like story,

1593
01:16:03,326 --> 01:16:05,246
production value,

1594
01:16:05,246 --> 01:16:07,646
feelings.

1595
01:16:07,726 --> 01:16:10,246
You know, people forget

1596
01:16:10,326 --> 01:16:14,806
that the brain is
the biggest erogenous zone.

1597
01:16:14,806 --> 01:16:16,326
On you maybe.

1598
01:16:16,326 --> 01:16:18,286
Of course, you have to take
the good with the bad.

1599
01:16:18,286 --> 01:16:21,166
New technology permits us
to do very exciting things

1600
01:16:21,206 --> 01:16:23,646
In interactive
erotic software.

1601
01:16:23,726 --> 01:16:25,286
Wave of the future,
Dude.

1602
01:16:25,286 --> 01:16:28,726
100% electronic.

1603
01:16:28,726 --> 01:16:30,166
Well...

1604
01:16:30,246 --> 01:16:32,886
I still jerk off
manually.

1605
01:16:34,206 --> 01:16:35,246
Of course you do.

1606
01:16:35,246 --> 01:16:36,766
I can see you're anxious

1607
01:16:36,766 --> 01:16:38,246
for me to get to the point.

1608
01:16:38,326 --> 01:16:40,766
Well, here it is, Dude.

1609
01:16:40,806 --> 01:16:42,726
Where's Bunny?

1610
01:16:42,846 --> 01:16:44,725
Well, I thought you
might know that, man.

1611
01:16:44,765 --> 01:16:46,205
Why would I?

1612
01:16:46,285 --> 01:16:47,805
She only ran off

1613
01:16:47,805 --> 01:16:50,125
to get away from that
rather sizable debt to me.

1614
01:16:50,205 --> 01:16:52,605
No. She didn't run off.
She's been..

1615
01:16:52,685 --> 01:16:54,565
I've heard that kidnapping
story, so save it.

1616
01:16:54,605 --> 01:16:57,645
I know you're mixed up
in all this, Dude,

1617
01:16:57,685 --> 01:17:01,205
And I don't care what you're
trying to get from the husband.

1618
01:17:01,245 --> 01:17:02,645
That's your business.

1619
01:17:02,685 --> 01:17:05,325
All I'm saying is...

1620
01:17:05,365 --> 01:17:06,845
I want mine.

1621
01:17:06,885 --> 01:17:08,325
Yeah, right, man.

1622
01:17:08,365 --> 01:17:10,405
I mean, there are
a lot of, um,

1623
01:17:10,445 --> 01:17:14,445
Facets to this, a lot
of interested parties.

1624
01:17:15,405 --> 01:17:16,885
Excuse me.

1625
01:17:25,405 --> 01:17:26,245
Where's that?

1626
01:17:29,845 --> 01:17:31,325
All right.

1627
01:17:35,285 --> 01:17:36,285
Excuse me.

1628
01:18:11,804 --> 01:18:13,284
Forgive me.

1629
01:18:13,364 --> 01:18:15,764
No problemo, man.

1630
01:18:17,244 --> 01:18:21,684
If I can find
your money...

1631
01:18:21,684 --> 01:18:24,724
Uh, what's in it
for The Dude?

1632
01:18:24,804 --> 01:18:26,324
Well, of course,
there's that to discuss.

1633
01:18:26,324 --> 01:18:27,964
Uh, refill?

1634
01:18:27,964 --> 01:18:29,484
Yeah. The pope
shit in the woods?

1635
01:18:29,564 --> 01:18:30,964
10% finder's fee.

1636
01:18:31,004 --> 01:18:32,004
That all right?

1637
01:18:33,044 --> 01:18:34,004
Done, Jackie.

1638
01:18:34,084 --> 01:18:37,444
Yeah. I dig the way
you do business, man.

1639
01:18:37,524 --> 01:18:39,044
Your money
is being held

1640
01:18:39,044 --> 01:18:41,364
By a kid named
Larry Sellers.

1641
01:18:41,404 --> 01:18:42,924
He lives
in north Hollywood,

1642
01:18:42,924 --> 01:18:44,444
On Radford ...

1643
01:18:44,524 --> 01:18:47,564
by the
in-n-out burger.

1644
01:18:47,644 --> 01:18:50,604
A fuckin' brat,
but I'm sure your goons

1645
01:18:50,644 --> 01:18:54,484
can get it off him.
I mean, he's 15.

1646
01:18:54,524 --> 01:18:57,644
Flunking social studies.

1647
01:19:01,164 --> 01:19:03,604
So, if you could just ..

1648
01:19:03,644 --> 01:19:07,564
Write me a check for my
10% of half a million...

1649
01:19:07,604 --> 01:19:10,004
5 grand...

1650
01:19:10,044 --> 01:19:11,524
I'll go out and mingle

1651
01:19:15,564 --> 01:19:18,524
You mix a hell
of a Caucasian, Jackie.

1652
01:19:19,604 --> 01:19:22,084
A 15-year-old kid.

1653
01:19:22,124 --> 01:19:26,003
Is this
some sort of a joke?

1654
01:19:26,083 --> 01:19:27,643
No, no joke.

1655
01:19:27,643 --> 01:19:31,523
No funny stuff, Jackie.
the kid's got it.

1656
01:19:31,603 --> 01:19:33,083
Hi, fellas.

1657
01:19:35,723 --> 01:19:37,803
The kid just wanted
a car.

1658
01:19:40,603 --> 01:19:44,483
All The Dude ever wanted
was his rug back.

1659
01:19:44,523 --> 01:19:46,163
I'm not greedy.

1660
01:19:47,043 --> 01:19:50,523
It would really...

1661
01:19:50,603 --> 01:19:52,163
Tie the room together.

1662
01:19:54,523 --> 01:19:57,483
Darkness washed over The Dude.

1663
01:19:57,563 --> 01:20:00,603
Darker than
a black steer's took us

1664
01:20:00,603 --> 01:20:03,563
On a moonless prairie night.

1665
01:20:03,563 --> 01:20:07,083
There was no bottom.

1666
01:20:23,363 --> 01:20:27,123
# What condition
my condition was in #

1667
01:20:28,843 --> 01:20:31,963
# I woke up this morning
with the sun down #

1668
01:20:32,003 --> 01:20:34,563
# Shinin' in him #

1669
01:20:36,883 --> 01:20:41,843
# I found my mind
in a brown paper bag #

1670
01:20:41,883 --> 01:20:42,923
# But then #

1671
01:20:45,442 --> 01:20:49,362
# I tripped on a cloud
and fell 8 miles high #

1672
01:20:49,362 --> 01:20:53,562
# I tore my mind
on a jagged sky #

1673
01:20:53,562 --> 01:20:55,962
# I just dropped in #

1674
01:20:55,962 --> 01:21:00,562
# To see what condition
my condition was in #

1675
01:21:00,562 --> 01:21:02,922
# Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah #

1676
01:21:02,922 --> 01:21:05,842
# What condition
my condition was in #

1677
01:21:12,522 --> 01:21:16,282
# I pushed my soul
in a deep dark hole #

1678
01:21:16,282 --> 01:21:19,002
# And then
I followed it in #

1679
01:21:21,002 --> 01:21:23,962
# I watched myself
crawlin' out #

1680
01:21:24,002 --> 01:21:28,562
# As I was crawlin' in #

1681
01:21:28,562 --> 01:21:30,362
# I got up so tight #

1682
01:21:30,482 --> 01:21:32,922
# I couldn't unwind #

1683
01:21:32,962 --> 01:21:34,962
# I saw so much #

1684
01:21:35,002 --> 01:21:37,402
# I broke my mind #

1685
01:21:37,482 --> 01:21:39,442
# I just dropped in #

1686
01:21:39,482 --> 01:21:43,642
# To see what condition
my condition was in #

1687
01:21:52,602 --> 01:21:55,082
# Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah #

1688
01:21:55,122 --> 01:21:58,642
# What condition
my condition was in #

1689
01:22:03,881 --> 01:22:07,481
# Someone
painted echoes on #

1690
01:22:07,641 --> 01:22:08,521
# In big black letters #

1691
01:22:08,521 --> 01:22:10,521
# On the dead inside #

1692
01:22:12,601 --> 01:22:14,561
# I kept my foot
on the gas #

1693
01:22:14,641 --> 01:22:16,441
# As I left the road #

1694
01:22:16,601 --> 01:22:19,961
# Blew out my mind #

1695
01:22:19,961 --> 01:22:24,481
# 8 miles out of Memphis,
and I got no spare #

1696
01:22:24,481 --> 01:22:28,921
# 8 miles straightened up
downtown somewhere #

1697
01:22:28,921 --> 01:22:31,041
# I just dropped in #

1698
01:22:31,041 --> 01:22:35,601
# To see what condition
my condition was in #

1699
01:22:37,121 --> 01:22:39,561
# I said,
I just dropped in #

1700
01:22:39,561 --> 01:22:44,081
# To see what condition
my condition was in #

1701
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:55,560
But the charge was true

1702
01:23:55,640 --> 01:24:00,000
and they say
he ran away

1703
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,040
branded!

1704
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:17,560
Is this your only I.D.?

1705
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:19,720
I know my rights,
man.

1706
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:24,080
You don't know shit,
Lebowski.

1707
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:26,120
I want
a fucking lawyer, man.

1708
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:28,120
I want...

1709
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:30,640
Bill Kunstler, man.

1710
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:33,600
Or Ron Coobie.

1711
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:35,200
Mr. Treehorn tells us

1712
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:38,560
that he had to eject you
from his garden party,

1713
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:41,680
that you were drunk
and abusive.

1714
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:47,039
Mr. Treehorn treats objects
like women, man.

1715
01:24:47,159 --> 01:24:49,559
Mr. Treehorn draws
a lot of water in this town.

1716
01:24:49,559 --> 01:24:52,119
You don't draw shit,
Lebowski.

1717
01:24:52,119 --> 01:24:55,639
Now we got a nice quiet
little beach community here,

1718
01:24:55,719 --> 01:24:57,679
and I aim to keep it
nice and quiet.

1719
01:24:57,679 --> 01:25:00,679
So let me
make something plain.

1720
01:25:00,679 --> 01:25:02,599
I don't like you
sucking around,

1721
01:25:02,679 --> 01:25:05,079
bothering our citizens,
Lebowski.

1722
01:25:05,119 --> 01:25:07,679
I don't like
your jerk-off name,

1723
01:25:07,679 --> 01:25:09,759
I don't like
your jerk-off face,

1724
01:25:09,759 --> 01:25:11,199
I don't like
your jerk-off behavior,

1725
01:25:11,239 --> 01:25:12,999
And I don't like you...

1726
01:25:13,119 --> 01:25:14,599
Jerk-off.

1727
01:25:17,199 --> 01:25:20,279
Do I make myself clear?

1728
01:25:22,279 --> 01:25:25,679
I'm sorry.
I wasn't listening.

1729
01:25:27,799 --> 01:25:29,199
Fucking fascist!

1730
01:25:30,759 --> 01:25:32,759
Stay out of Malibu,
Lebowski!

1731
01:25:33,839 --> 01:25:36,719
Stay out of Malibu,
deadbeat!

1732
01:25:36,759 --> 01:25:39,239
Keep your ugly fucking
gold-bricking ass

1733
01:25:39,279 --> 01:25:42,119
out of
my beach community.

1734
01:25:42,159 --> 01:25:48,639
# I want to sleep with you
in the desert tonight #

1735
01:25:48,679 --> 01:25:53,679
# With a billion stars
all around #

1736
01:25:53,719 --> 01:25:55,199
Jesus...

1737
01:25:55,239 --> 01:25:57,719
Man, could you
change the channel?

1738
01:25:57,759 --> 01:25:59,799
Fuck you, man!
if you don't like my music,

1739
01:25:59,839 --> 01:26:00,719
get your own fucking cab!

1740
01:26:00,759 --> 01:26:02,239
I had a really rough

1741
01:26:02,278 --> 01:26:04,278
I'll pull over
and kiss your ass out.

1742
01:26:04,318 --> 01:26:06,198
Man, come on,
I had a rough night,

1743
01:26:06,198 --> 01:26:09,918
And I hate
the fucking eagles, man.

1744
01:26:16,158 --> 01:26:17,678
Out of my fucking cab!

1745
01:26:39,758 --> 01:26:41,678
# Devil-may-care #

1746
01:26:41,678 --> 01:26:45,158
# And I'm the devil
with love to spare #

1747
01:26:45,158 --> 01:26:49,838
# So viva, Las Vegas #

1748
01:26:49,918 --> 01:26:53,358
# Viva, Las Vegas #

1749
01:27:27,397 --> 01:27:28,917
Jeffrey.

1750
01:27:28,997 --> 01:27:31,397
Maude?

1751
01:27:31,437 --> 01:27:32,917
Love me.

1752
01:27:34,357 --> 01:27:36,837
Uh, that's my robe.

1753
01:27:36,877 --> 01:27:40,677
Tell me about
yourself, Jeffrey.

1754
01:27:40,797 --> 01:27:43,077
Well, not much
to tell.

1755
01:27:43,117 --> 01:27:48,197
I, um, I was one
of the authors

1756
01:27:48,237 --> 01:27:51,197
of the port Huron
Statement.

1757
01:27:51,237 --> 01:27:53,117
The original
Port Huron Statement.

1758
01:27:54,157 --> 01:27:58,357
Not the compromised
second draft.

1759
01:27:59,797 --> 01:28:02,677
Uh, and then I,

1760
01:28:02,677 --> 01:28:04,197
you ever hear
of the Seattle 7?

1761
01:28:05,277 --> 01:28:08,197
That was me.

1762
01:28:08,237 --> 01:28:12,677
And, um,
the 6 other guys.

1763
01:28:12,717 --> 01:28:16,757
Um, and then
a music business briefly.

1764
01:28:17,797 --> 01:28:20,197
Yeah, a roadie
for Metallica.

1765
01:28:21,277 --> 01:28:23,277
Speed of sound tour.

1766
01:28:25,237 --> 01:28:27,797
Bunch of assholes.

1767
01:28:27,877 --> 01:28:29,677
Uh, and then,
you know,

1768
01:28:29,677 --> 01:28:32,717
A little of this,
a little of that.

1769
01:28:32,757 --> 01:28:36,117
My career's slowed down
a little lately.

1770
01:28:36,237 --> 01:28:40,277
What do you do
for recreation?

1771
01:28:40,317 --> 01:28:45,756
Oh, the usual.
Bowl, drive around.

1772
01:28:45,756 --> 01:28:48,916
The occasional
acid flashback.

1773
01:28:54,756 --> 01:28:57,156
What happened
to your house?

1774
01:28:57,156 --> 01:28:59,236
Oh, Jackie Treehorn
trashed the place.

1775
01:28:59,236 --> 01:29:02,116
He thought I had
your father's money.

1776
01:29:02,196 --> 01:29:05,236
He got me out of the way
while he looked for it.

1777
01:29:05,316 --> 01:29:06,276
Cocktail?

1778
01:29:06,356 --> 01:29:07,716
No, thanks.

1779
01:29:07,836 --> 01:29:09,316
It's not my
father's money.

1780
01:29:09,316 --> 01:29:11,276
It's the
Foundation's.

1781
01:29:11,276 --> 01:29:13,316
Why did he think
you have it?

1782
01:29:13,396 --> 01:29:14,876
And who does?

1783
01:29:14,876 --> 01:29:17,756
Oh, Larry Sellers,
this high school kid.

1784
01:29:17,836 --> 01:29:19,276
Real fucking brat.

1785
01:29:19,276 --> 01:29:22,756
You know, this is a very
complicated case, Maude.

1786
01:29:22,756 --> 01:29:25,676
Lotta ins, lotta outs.

1787
01:29:25,756 --> 01:29:26,676
You know, fortunately,

1788
01:29:26,676 --> 01:29:29,076
I'm adhering to
a pretty strict,

1789
01:29:29,156 --> 01:29:31,596
drug regiment to keep
my mind, you know,

1790
01:29:31,676 --> 01:29:33,676
Uh, limber, you know.

1791
01:29:33,756 --> 01:29:36,316
Very fucking close
to your father's money.

1792
01:29:36,316 --> 01:29:38,836
I keep telling you it's
the Foundation's money.

1793
01:29:38,876 --> 01:29:40,356
Father doesn't have any.

1794
01:29:42,316 --> 01:29:44,276
What are you talking about?
he's fucking loaded.

1795
01:29:44,276 --> 01:29:47,196
No, no, the wealth
was all mother's.

1796
01:29:47,236 --> 01:29:49,276
No, he runs stuff,

1797
01:29:49,316 --> 01:29:51,916
We did let him run one
of the companies briefly,

1798
01:29:51,916 --> 01:29:53,196
But he didn't do
very well at it.

1799
01:29:53,236 --> 01:29:54,836
No, he's, you know.

1800
01:29:54,876 --> 01:29:56,156
No, he helps administer
the charities now,

1801
01:29:56,196 --> 01:29:59,716
and I give him
a reasonable allowance.

1802
01:29:59,756 --> 01:30:01,316
He has no money
of his own.

1803
01:30:01,316 --> 01:30:03,235
I know how he likes
to present himself.

1804
01:30:03,275 --> 01:30:05,315
Father's weakness
is vanity.

1805
01:30:05,355 --> 01:30:06,315
Hence, the slut.

1806
01:30:06,355 --> 01:30:11,755
Uh, do you think he,

1807
01:30:11,795 --> 01:30:13,235
What is that, yoga?

1808
01:30:13,275 --> 01:30:15,755
It increases the chances
of conception.

1809
01:30:18,835 --> 01:30:19,795
Increases?

1810
01:30:19,875 --> 01:30:21,115
Well, yes.

1811
01:30:21,155 --> 01:30:22,715
What did you think
this was all about?

1812
01:30:22,715 --> 01:30:23,675
Fun and games?

1813
01:30:23,715 --> 01:30:26,755
I want a child.

1814
01:30:26,795 --> 01:30:29,155
Ok, yeah, ok,
but let me

1815
01:30:29,195 --> 01:30:31,235
Let me explain
something about The Dude.

1816
01:30:31,275 --> 01:30:33,275
Uh, look, Jeffrey,

1817
01:30:33,315 --> 01:30:34,795
I don't want
a partner.

1818
01:30:34,835 --> 01:30:36,875
In fact, I don't
want the father

1819
01:30:36,915 --> 01:30:38,875
to be someone
I have to see socially

1820
01:30:38,915 --> 01:30:40,355
or who'll have
any interest

1821
01:30:40,395 --> 01:30:41,955
in raising
the child himself.

1822
01:30:41,995 --> 01:30:45,715
Oh, so that doctor

1823
01:30:45,835 --> 01:30:51,235
Exactly. Now, what
happened to your face?

1824
01:30:51,235 --> 01:30:53,195
Did Jackie Treehorn
Do that as well?

1825
01:30:53,235 --> 01:30:57,235
No, it was the chief
of police of Malibu.

1826
01:30:57,315 --> 01:30:58,835
A real reactionary.

1827
01:30:58,835 --> 01:31:02,875
So, your father...

1828
01:31:02,955 --> 01:31:04,835
Oh, yeah, I get it.

1829
01:31:05,955 --> 01:31:08,395
Oh, man, my thinking
about this case

1830
01:31:08,475 --> 01:31:12,955
had become very uptight.
Yeah, your father.

1831
01:31:14,315 --> 01:31:16,995
Jeffrey, what are
you talking about?

1832
01:31:19,835 --> 01:31:21,395
Walter, if you're there,

1833
01:31:21,395 --> 01:31:25,274
pick up the fucking phone,
man, come on, Walter.

1834
01:31:25,354 --> 01:31:27,314
Pick it up, man,
this is an emergency.

1835
01:31:27,314 --> 01:31:28,354
Come on, enough--Dude?

1836
01:31:28,354 --> 01:31:30,794
Yeah, listen, Walter,
I'm at my place.

1837
01:31:30,874 --> 01:31:32,274
I need you to come
pick me up.

1838
01:31:32,354 --> 01:31:33,874
I can't drive, Dude,
It's Erev Shabbos.

1839
01:31:33,874 --> 01:31:37,354
What?
Erev Shabbos.

1840
01:31:37,434 --> 01:31:39,914
I can't drive.
Man!

1841
01:31:39,994 --> 01:31:40,874
I'm not even supposed
to pick up the phone

1842
01:31:40,914 --> 01:31:42,354
unless it's
an emergency.

1843
01:31:42,394 --> 01:31:44,794
This is
a fucking emergency.

1844
01:31:44,834 --> 01:31:47,314
I understand. That's why
I picked up the phone.

1845
01:31:47,314 --> 01:31:48,754
Walter, you fuck,

1846
01:31:48,794 --> 01:31:50,754
we gotta go
to Pasadena, man.

1847
01:31:50,754 --> 01:31:53,594
Come pick me up or I’m off
the fucking bowling team.

1848
01:32:09,034 --> 01:32:11,794
Get out of that
fucking car, man.

1849
01:32:12,394 --> 01:32:14,874
Get out of that
fucking car!

1850
01:32:14,914 --> 01:32:18,034
Get the fuck out
of the car, man.

1851
01:32:19,434 --> 01:32:21,474
Get out of
the fucking

1852
01:32:21,514 --> 01:32:22,954
Who the fuck
are you, man?

1853
01:32:22,994 --> 01:32:25,954
Easy, man.
Relax, man.

1854
01:32:26,034 --> 01:32:27,994
No physical harm
intended.

1855
01:32:28,034 --> 01:32:29,034
Who the fuck
are you?

1856
01:32:29,074 --> 01:32:30,474
Why are you
following me around?

1857
01:32:30,514 --> 01:32:32,034
Come on, fuckhead.

1858
01:32:32,034 --> 01:32:34,554
Relax, man.
I'm a brother Seamus.

1859
01:32:34,594 --> 01:32:36,074
Brother Seamus?

1860
01:32:38,154 --> 01:32:39,514
Like an Irish monk?

1861
01:32:39,554 --> 01:32:41,433
What the fuck are you
talking about?

1862
01:32:41,433 --> 01:32:42,953
My name is Da Fino.

1863
01:32:43,033 --> 01:32:46,033
I'm a private snoop,
like you, man.

1864
01:32:47,913 --> 01:32:48,753
A dick, man.

1865
01:32:48,833 --> 01:32:52,473
And let me tell you
something. I dig your work.

1866
01:32:52,473 --> 01:32:54,033
Playing one side
against the other.

1867
01:32:54,113 --> 01:32:56,513
In bed with everybody.
Fabulous stuff, man.

1868
01:32:56,593 --> 01:32:58,473
I'm not..fuck it, man.

1869
01:32:58,553 --> 01:33:00,993
Just stay away from
my fucking lady friend.

1870
01:33:01,073 --> 01:33:03,513
Hey, hey, I’m not messing
with your special lady.

1871
01:33:03,553 --> 01:33:04,993
She's not
my special lady.

1872
01:33:04,993 --> 01:33:06,033
She's my fucking
lady friend.

1873
01:33:06,033 --> 01:33:07,993
I'm just helping
her conceive, man.

1874
01:33:08,073 --> 01:33:08,913
Hey, man, I'm not

1875
01:33:08,993 --> 01:33:09,913
Who are you
working for?

1876
01:33:09,913 --> 01:33:11,433
Lebowski?

1877
01:33:11,513 --> 01:33:13,633
Jackie Treehorn?

1878
01:33:14,553 --> 01:33:15,913
The Knutsens.

1879
01:33:15,993 --> 01:33:20,353
The--who the fuck
are the Knutsens?

1880
01:33:20,513 --> 01:33:24,393
The Knutsen's. It's
a wandering daughter job.

1881
01:33:25,433 --> 01:33:27,953
Bunny Lebowski, man.

1882
01:33:27,953 --> 01:33:30,833
Her real name
is Fawn Knutsen.

1883
01:33:30,913 --> 01:33:33,473
Her parents want her back.

1884
01:33:33,473 --> 01:33:35,873
Jesus fucking Christ.

1885
01:33:35,873 --> 01:33:38,713
Crazy, huh? Ran away
about a year ago.

1886
01:33:38,833 --> 01:33:41,233
The Knutsens told me
I should show her this

1887
01:33:41,273 --> 01:33:42,273
when I found her.

1888
01:33:42,313 --> 01:33:43,873
It's the family farm.

1889
01:33:43,953 --> 01:33:46,353
It's outside of
Moorhead, Minnesota.

1890
01:33:46,433 --> 01:33:47,833
They think it'll
make her homesick.

1891
01:33:47,913 --> 01:33:49,793
Oh, boy.
How are you gonna

1892
01:33:49,873 --> 01:33:50,833
keep 'em
down on the farm

1893
01:33:50,913 --> 01:33:53,953
once they've seen
Karl Hungus?

1894
01:33:54,033 --> 01:33:55,433
She's been
kidnapped, Da Fino.

1895
01:33:56,593 --> 01:33:57,433
Oh, I don't know.
maybe not,

1896
01:33:57,513 --> 01:33:59,513
But she's definitely
not around.

1897
01:33:59,593 --> 01:34:03,752
Hey, maybe you and me
could pool our resources.

1898
01:34:03,912 --> 01:34:07,832
Trade information.
Professional courtesy.

1899
01:34:07,912 --> 01:34:09,472
Compeers, you know
what I mean?

1900
01:34:09,472 --> 01:34:11,912
I get it.
Fuck off, Da Fino.

1901
01:34:11,952 --> 01:34:13,872
And stay away
from my special

1902
01:34:13,912 --> 01:34:17,632
From my fucking
lady friend, man.

1903
01:34:19,432 --> 01:34:21,992
Ze lingonberry
pancakes.

1904
01:34:26,032 --> 01:34:28,072
Lingonberry pancakes.

1905
01:34:31,472 --> 01:34:34,472
Sree pigs in blanket.

1906
01:34:39,392 --> 01:34:41,512
She has lingonberry
pancakes.

1907
01:34:49,872 --> 01:34:52,512
I mean we totally
fucked it up, man.

1908
01:34:52,552 --> 01:34:53,432
We fucked up his payoff,

1909
01:34:53,472 --> 01:34:55,912
we got the kidnappers
all pissed off,

1910
01:34:55,912 --> 01:34:57,872
And Lebowski, you know,
he yelled at me a lot,

1911
01:34:57,912 --> 01:34:59,832
But he didn't
do anything?

1912
01:34:59,912 --> 01:35:01,872
Well, sometimes
it's a cathartic

1913
01:35:01,952 --> 01:35:04,912
No, no, I'm saying if
he knows I’m a fuck-up,

1914
01:35:04,912 --> 01:35:05,792
why does he
leave me in charge

1915
01:35:05,912 --> 01:35:07,432
Of getting his wife back?

1916
01:35:07,432 --> 01:35:10,872
Because he doesn't fucking
want her back, man.

1917
01:35:10,872 --> 01:35:12,952
He's had enough.
He no longer digs her.

1918
01:35:12,952 --> 01:35:14,392
It's all a show.

1919
01:35:14,432 --> 01:35:16,872
Ok, but then, why
doesn't he give a shit

1920
01:35:16,952 --> 01:35:18,432
About his million bucks?

1921
01:35:18,432 --> 01:35:21,311
I mean, he knows we never
handed off his briefcase,

1922
01:35:21,391 --> 01:35:23,991
but he never asked
for it back.

1923
01:35:23,991 --> 01:35:27,431
The million bucks was
never in the briefcase.

1924
01:35:27,431 --> 01:35:30,671
The briefcase was
fucking empty, man.

1925
01:35:30,671 --> 01:35:33,671
The asshole was hoping
that they would kill her.

1926
01:35:33,671 --> 01:35:36,231
You threw out a ringer
for a ringer.

1927
01:35:36,231 --> 01:35:37,591
Ok, but how does
this all add up

1928
01:35:37,671 --> 01:35:39,671
To an emergency?

1929
01:35:39,751 --> 01:35:42,511
I'm saying I see what
you're getting at, Dude,

1930
01:35:42,591 --> 01:35:44,151
He kept the money.

1931
01:35:44,151 --> 01:35:45,511
My point is,

1932
01:35:45,591 --> 01:35:48,031
here we are,
it's Shabbos,

1933
01:35:48,151 --> 01:35:50,111
the Sabbath, which
I'm allowed to break

1934
01:35:50,231 --> 01:35:53,071
only if it's a matter
of life or death.

1935
01:35:53,071 --> 01:35:54,591
Will you come off it,
Walter?

1936
01:35:54,711 --> 01:35:55,951
You're not even
fucking Jewish, man.

1937
01:35:56,031 --> 01:35:58,471
What the fuck are
you talking about?

1938
01:35:58,591 --> 01:36:00,071
You're fucking
Polish-catholic.

1939
01:36:00,071 --> 01:36:01,631
What the fuck are
you talking about?

1940
01:36:01,711 --> 01:36:03,191
I converted when
I married Cynthia.

1941
01:36:03,191 --> 01:36:04,671
Come on, Dude.
Yeah, yeah.

1942
01:36:04,711 --> 01:36:06,151
You know this.

1943
01:36:06,191 --> 01:36:08,151
And 5 fucking years ago,
you were divorced.

1944
01:36:08,231 --> 01:36:09,631
So what are saying?
When you get divorced,

1945
01:36:09,671 --> 01:36:11,191
You turn in
your library card?

1946
01:36:11,231 --> 01:36:13,711
You get a new license?
You stop being Jewish?

1947
01:36:13,791 --> 01:36:15,111
This is
the driveway, huh?

1948
01:36:15,151 --> 01:36:16,751
I'm Jewish as
fucking Tevye.

1949
01:36:16,791 --> 01:36:19,231
Man, you know,
it's all a part

1950
01:36:19,311 --> 01:36:21,871
of your sick
Cynthia thing.

1951
01:36:21,871 --> 01:36:23,711
Man, taking care
of her fucking dog.

1952
01:36:23,791 --> 01:36:25,671
Going to her
fucking synagogue.

1953
01:36:25,711 --> 01:36:27,631
You're living in
the fucking past.

1954
01:36:27,671 --> 01:36:29,271
3,000 years of
beautiful tradition

1955
01:36:29,311 --> 01:36:31,271
from Moses
to Sandy Koufax,

1956
01:36:31,271 --> 01:36:32,311
you're goddamn right

1957
01:36:32,311 --> 01:36:34,231
I'm living in
the fucking past!

1958
01:36:36,671 --> 01:36:40,311
What the hell
happened?

1959
01:36:58,950 --> 01:37:00,510
Where was she, man?

1960
01:37:00,590 --> 01:37:01,950
Visiting friends of hers
in palm springs.

1961
01:37:01,990 --> 01:37:03,590
She just picked up
and left.

1962
01:37:03,630 --> 01:37:04,990
Never bothered
to tell us.

1963
01:37:05,070 --> 01:37:07,470
Well, I guess the fucking
nihilist knew where she was.

1964
01:37:07,550 --> 01:37:10,030
Jesus, Dude, she never
even kidnapped herself.

1965
01:37:10,030 --> 01:37:11,510
Who is this gentleman,
Dude?

1966
01:37:11,630 --> 01:37:13,550
Who am I? I'm
a fucking veteran.

1967
01:37:13,550 --> 01:37:15,510
He shouldn't go
in there, Dude.

1968
01:37:15,550 --> 01:37:17,030
He's very angry.

1969
01:37:19,670 --> 01:37:20,430
Hello, man.

1970
01:37:20,430 --> 01:37:25,070
So, she's back,
no thanks to you.

1971
01:37:25,070 --> 01:37:27,030
Where's the fucking
money, Lebowski?

1972
01:37:27,030 --> 01:37:28,990
A million bucks
from fucking needy

1973
01:37:29,070 --> 01:37:30,590
Little urban
achievers!

1974
01:37:30,590 --> 01:37:31,990
You are scum, man!

1975
01:37:32,070 --> 01:37:33,470
Who the hell is he?

1976
01:37:33,550 --> 01:37:34,510
Who am I? Who am I?

1977
01:37:34,590 --> 01:37:35,510
I'm the guy
that's gonna kick

1978
01:37:35,630 --> 01:37:37,510
Your phony goldbricking
ass! That's who I am.

1979
01:37:37,550 --> 01:37:39,550
Man, we know the briefcase
was fucking empty.

1980
01:37:39,550 --> 01:37:41,510
We know you kept the million
bucks for yourself.

1981
01:37:41,590 --> 01:37:43,110
You have your story,
I have mine.

1982
01:37:43,110 --> 01:37:45,550
I say I entrusted
the money to you,

1983
01:37:45,630 --> 01:37:46,550
And you stole it.

1984
01:37:46,550 --> 01:37:48,510
As if we would ever
dream of taking

1985
01:37:48,510 --> 01:37:49,990
your bullshit
money!

1986
01:37:49,990 --> 01:37:52,430
You thought that Bunny
had been kidnapped,

1987
01:37:52,510 --> 01:37:54,030
and you were
fucking glad, man.

1988
01:37:54,030 --> 01:37:56,110
You could use it as an excuse
to make some money disappear.

1989
01:37:56,110 --> 01:37:58,070
All you needed was a sap
to pin it on.

1990
01:37:58,150 --> 01:38:02,549
You just met me.
You human paraquat!

1991
01:38:02,629 --> 01:38:04,949
You figured, oh,
here's a loser, you know.

1992
01:38:05,029 --> 01:38:07,429
A deadbeat.
somebody the square community

1993
01:38:07,549 --> 01:38:08,509
Won't give a shit about.

1994
01:38:08,589 --> 01:38:10,749
Well, aren't you?

1995
01:38:11,589 --> 01:38:14,589
Well, yeah, but

1996
01:38:14,589 --> 01:38:15,949
Get out, both of you.

1997
01:38:15,949 --> 01:38:16,989
Look at that
fucking phony, Dude.

1998
01:38:16,989 --> 01:38:18,909
Pretending to be a
fucking millionaire.

1999
01:38:18,949 --> 01:38:21,469
Out of this house now,
you bums!

2000
01:38:21,469 --> 01:38:22,949
Let me tell you
something else.

2001
01:38:23,069 --> 01:38:25,469
I've seen a lot of
spinals, Dude,

2002
01:38:25,509 --> 01:38:27,469
And this guy's
a fake.

2003
01:38:27,549 --> 01:38:28,869
A fucking
goldbricker.

2004
01:38:28,909 --> 01:38:30,509
Stay away from me,
mister!

2005
01:38:30,549 --> 01:38:32,469
This guy
fucking walks.

2006
01:38:32,509 --> 01:38:33,629
I've never been
more certain

2007
01:38:33,669 --> 01:38:35,149
of anything
in my life.

2008
01:38:35,189 --> 01:38:35,989
You stay away from me!

2009
01:38:36,069 --> 01:38:38,549
Walter, for Christ's sake,
man, he's a cripple.

2010
01:38:38,589 --> 01:38:40,069
Come on, come on.

2011
01:38:40,109 --> 01:38:41,109
Get away from me!

2012
01:38:43,189 --> 01:38:44,069
Put him down, man!

2013
01:38:44,109 --> 01:38:45,549
Yeah, I'll put
him down, Dude!

2014
01:38:45,629 --> 01:38:50,869
Rauss! Achtung, baby!

2015
01:39:05,149 --> 01:39:07,709
Come on, man, help me
put him back in his chair.

2016
01:39:27,588 --> 01:39:30,028
Sure, you'll see
some tank battles.

2017
01:39:30,028 --> 01:39:31,988
But fighting in desert
is very different

2018
01:39:32,068 --> 01:39:34,548
from fighting
in canopy jungle.

2019
01:39:34,588 --> 01:39:36,628
I mean 'nam was
a foot soldier's war.

2020
01:39:36,628 --> 01:39:39,908
Whereas, this thing
should, you know,

2021
01:39:39,988 --> 01:39:41,548
should be
a piece of cake.

2022
01:39:41,548 --> 01:39:42,988
I mean, I had
an M16, Jacko.

2023
01:39:42,988 --> 01:39:44,948
Not an Abrams
fucking tank.

2024
01:39:44,948 --> 01:39:47,548
Me and Charlie,
eyeball to eyeball.

2025
01:39:47,628 --> 01:39:48,548
Yeah.

2026
01:39:48,548 --> 01:39:51,068
That's fuckin' combat.

2027
01:39:51,188 --> 01:39:53,628
The man in the
black pajamas, Dude.

2028
01:39:53,628 --> 01:39:55,588
Worthy fuckin'
adversary.

2029
01:39:55,668 --> 01:39:56,628
Who's in
pajamas, Walter?

2030
01:39:56,708 --> 01:39:59,148
Shut the fuck up,
Donny.

2031
01:39:59,148 --> 01:40:01,668
Whereas, what we
have here...

2032
01:40:01,668 --> 01:40:03,548
Lots of fig-eaters wearing
towels on their heads,

2033
01:40:03,548 --> 01:40:05,668
trying to find reverse
on a soviet tank.

2034
01:40:05,668 --> 01:40:07,628
This .. is not
a worthy

2035
01:40:07,628 --> 01:40:08,668
Hey!

2036
01:40:08,668 --> 01:40:11,068
What's this
day of rest shit?

2037
01:40:11,068 --> 01:40:13,028
What's this bullshit!

2038
01:40:13,028 --> 01:40:14,508
I don't fuckin' care!

2039
01:40:14,508 --> 01:40:16,028
It don't matter
to Jesus.

2040
01:40:16,068 --> 01:40:17,628
But you not
fooling me, man.

2041
01:40:17,628 --> 01:40:20,108
You might fool the fucks
in the league office,

2042
01:40:20,148 --> 01:40:22,588
but you don't
fool Jesus.

2043
01:40:22,668 --> 01:40:25,628
It's bush league
psyche-out stuff.

2044
01:40:25,668 --> 01:40:28,028
Laughable, man. Ha ha!

2045
01:40:28,228 --> 01:40:32,188
I would have fucked you
in the ass Saturday.

2046
01:40:32,228 --> 01:40:35,508
I'll fuck you in the ass
Next Wednesday instead.

2047
01:40:35,548 --> 01:40:39,228
Whoo! You got a date
Wednesday, baby.

2048
01:40:43,587 --> 01:40:45,507
He's cracking.

2049
01:40:45,547 --> 01:40:46,547
The whole concept of Asia.

2050
01:40:46,587 --> 01:40:49,067
I mean, many learned men
have disputed this,

2051
01:40:49,107 --> 01:40:54,627
but in the 14th century.
the rabahm, he

2052
01:41:02,387 --> 01:41:04,147
Well, they
finally did it.

2053
01:41:04,267 --> 01:41:06,787
They killed
my fucking car.

2054
01:41:06,787 --> 01:41:10,267
We want some money,
Lebowski.

2055
01:41:10,267 --> 01:41:12,747
Ja, otherwise,
we kill the girl.

2056
01:41:12,787 --> 01:41:14,707
Ja, it seems
you have forgotten

2057
01:41:14,747 --> 01:41:16,387
Our little deal,
Lebowski.

2058
01:41:16,427 --> 01:41:19,467
You don't have the
fucking girl, dipshit.

2059
01:41:19,507 --> 01:41:21,907
We know you never did.

2060
01:41:21,947 --> 01:41:23,347
Are these the Nazis,
Walter?

2061
01:41:23,427 --> 01:41:24,987
No, Donny, these men
are nihilists.

2062
01:41:25,027 --> 01:41:26,427
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

2063
01:41:28,467 --> 01:41:31,427
Vee don't care. Vee
still want the money,

2064
01:41:31,427 --> 01:41:33,707
Lebowski, or
we'll fuck you up.

2065
01:41:33,747 --> 01:41:36,787
Fuck you.
Fuck the 3 of yous.

2066
01:41:36,827 --> 01:41:40,227
No, without a hostage,
there is no ransom.

2067
01:41:40,307 --> 01:41:41,747
That's what ransom is.

2068
01:41:41,787 --> 01:41:43,827
Those are the fucking rules.

2069
01:41:43,867 --> 01:41:45,907
His girlfriend
gave up her toe.

2070
01:41:45,947 --> 01:41:48,387
She zought we'd be
getting $1 million.

2071
01:41:48,387 --> 01:41:49,867
It's not fair.

2072
01:41:49,867 --> 01:41:53,387
Fair? Who's the fucking
nihilist around here?

2073
01:41:53,467 --> 01:41:54,867
You bunch of
fucking crybabies.

2074
01:41:54,947 --> 01:41:57,387
Cool it, Walter.
Hey, look, pal,

2075
01:41:57,387 --> 01:41:59,467
There never was
any money.

2076
01:41:59,467 --> 01:42:01,306
The big Lebowski gave
me an empty briefcase,

2077
01:42:01,346 --> 01:42:03,786
So take it up
with him, man.

2078
01:42:03,946 --> 01:42:06,346
Yeah, and I would like
my undies back.

2079
01:42:06,346 --> 01:42:07,386
Are these guys gonna
hurt us, Walter?

2080
01:42:07,386 --> 01:42:09,906
No, Donny, these
men are cowards.

2081
01:42:09,906 --> 01:42:13,346
Ok, so we take ze
money you haf on you

2082
01:42:13,346 --> 01:42:15,386
And we calls it
even.

2083
01:42:16,426 --> 01:42:17,386
Fuck you.

2084
01:42:17,506 --> 01:42:18,866
Hey, no, come on,
Walter, come on.

2085
01:42:18,866 --> 01:42:20,826
We're ending this
thing cheap, man.

2086
01:42:20,906 --> 01:42:21,866
No, what's mine is mine.

2087
01:42:21,946 --> 01:42:22,906
Oh, come on, Walter.

2088
01:42:22,986 --> 01:42:24,426
No funny stuff.

2089
01:42:24,426 --> 01:42:27,426
All right,
all right, I got,

2090
01:42:27,466 --> 01:42:30,386
Uh, 4 bucks,
almost 5.

2091
01:42:30,386 --> 01:42:31,226
I got $18.

2092
01:42:31,266 --> 01:42:33,306
What's
mine is mine.

2093
01:42:33,346 --> 01:42:36,306
We fuck you up, man.
We takes the money.

2094
01:42:36,466 --> 01:42:37,946
Come and get it.

2095
01:42:39,306 --> 01:42:41,826
We fuck you up.

2096
01:42:41,826 --> 01:42:43,946
Show me what
you got, nihilist.

2097
01:42:43,946 --> 01:42:45,346
I fuck you.

2098
01:42:45,386 --> 01:42:46,386
Walter, come on,
he's got a sword.

2099
01:42:46,426 --> 01:42:48,866
Fucking dipshit with
a 9-toed woman.

2100
01:42:48,986 --> 01:42:50,306
Fuck you!
Fuck you!

2101
01:42:50,346 --> 01:42:53,466
I fuck you up!

2102
01:42:59,426 --> 01:43:00,266
Take it easy, man.

2103
01:43:00,306 --> 01:43:01,826
Here's the $4.00.

2104
01:43:06,906 --> 01:43:09,986
I got a fucking ball, man.

2105
01:43:15,546 --> 01:43:16,946
Anti-semite!

2106
01:43:16,946 --> 01:43:18,906
I fuck you in ze ass.

2107
01:43:18,946 --> 01:43:20,425
I fuck you
in ze ass.

2108
01:43:20,465 --> 01:43:26,145
I fuck you!
I fuck you!

2109
01:43:31,905 --> 01:43:33,905
We got a man down, Dude.

2110
01:43:37,425 --> 01:43:39,465
God, they shot him,
man.

2111
01:43:39,545 --> 01:43:40,385
No, Dude.

2112
01:43:40,385 --> 01:43:41,465
They shot Donny?

2113
01:43:41,465 --> 01:43:42,345
There weren't
any shots fired.

2114
01:43:42,385 --> 01:43:44,465
It's a heart attack.

2115
01:43:44,505 --> 01:43:46,985
Call the medics, Dude.

2116
01:43:46,985 --> 01:43:49,985
I'd go myself, but I’m
pumping blood. Might pass out.

2117
01:43:50,025 --> 01:43:53,865
Rest easy, good buddy,
you're doing fine.

2118
01:43:53,865 --> 01:43:55,945
We got help
choppering in.

2119
01:44:23,385 --> 01:44:26,305
Hello, gentlemen.
You are the bereaved?

2120
01:44:26,305 --> 01:44:27,865
Yeah, man.

2121
01:44:27,865 --> 01:44:30,385
Francis Donnelly.
Pleased to meet you.

2122
01:44:30,385 --> 01:44:31,905
Jeff Lebowski.

2123
01:44:31,985 --> 01:44:33,385
Walter Sobchak.

2124
01:44:33,385 --> 01:44:36,385
The Dude, actually,
is,

2125
01:44:36,465 --> 01:44:37,425
Excuse me?

2126
01:44:37,505 --> 01:44:38,905
Oh, nothing.

2127
01:44:38,905 --> 01:44:44,984
Yes, I understand you're
taking away the remains.

2128
01:44:46,984 --> 01:44:49,784
We have the urn.

2129
01:44:49,944 --> 01:44:53,064
I assume this is
credit card.

2130
01:45:09,504 --> 01:45:10,384
What's this?

2131
01:45:10,424 --> 01:45:13,464
That's for the urn.

2132
01:45:13,504 --> 01:45:15,824
Don't need it. We're
Scattering the ashes.

2133
01:45:15,824 --> 01:45:18,944
Yes, so we
Were informed.

2134
01:45:18,984 --> 01:45:19,984
However, we must,
Of course,

2135
01:45:19,984 --> 01:45:24,104
Transmit the remains
To you in a receptacle.

2136
01:45:25,584 --> 01:45:27,624
This is $180.

2137
01:45:27,664 --> 01:45:31,464
It is our most modestly
priced receptacle.

2138
01:45:31,584 --> 01:45:34,064
Can we just..$180?

2139
01:45:34,064 --> 01:45:36,024
They range up to 3,000.

2140
01:45:38,144 --> 01:45:40,144
Can't we just
rent it from you?

2141
01:45:40,184 --> 01:45:43,144
Sir, this is a mortuary,
not a rental house.

2142
01:45:43,184 --> 01:45:44,944
We're scattering
the fucking ashes!

2143
01:45:44,984 --> 01:45:46,424
Look, just because
we're bereaved,

2144
01:45:46,504 --> 01:45:47,504
Doesn't
make us saps!

2145
01:45:47,544 --> 01:45:50,504
Sir, please,
lower your voices.

2146
01:45:50,584 --> 01:45:51,984
Man, don't you have,
you know,

2147
01:45:52,024 --> 01:45:55,984
Something else we could
put him in, you know?

2148
01:45:56,104 --> 01:45:59,064
That is our most modestly
priced receptacle.

2149
01:45:59,064 --> 01:46:00,103
God damn it!

2150
01:46:03,103 --> 01:46:05,223
Is there a Ralph’s
around here?

2151
01:46:31,623 --> 01:46:33,103
Donny was
a good bowler

2152
01:46:33,103 --> 01:46:35,543
And a good man.

2153
01:46:35,583 --> 01:46:37,583
He was one of us.

2154
01:46:37,583 --> 01:46:41,343
He was a man who loved
the outdoors and bowling.

2155
01:46:41,463 --> 01:46:43,423
And as a surfer,
he explored the beaches

2156
01:46:43,543 --> 01:46:45,503
of Southern California,

2157
01:46:45,503 --> 01:46:48,623
from La Jolla
to Leo Carrillo

2158
01:46:48,623 --> 01:46:51,583
and up to Pismo.

2159
01:46:51,623 --> 01:46:56,623
He died...as so
many men of his generation,

2160
01:46:56,663 --> 01:46:58,023
Before his time.

2161
01:46:58,183 --> 01:47:01,583
In your wisdom, Lord,
you took him.

2162
01:47:01,623 --> 01:47:05,183
As you took so many bright,
flowering young men

2163
01:47:05,183 --> 01:47:07,583
at Khe Sanh, at Lan Doc,

2164
01:47:07,623 --> 01:47:10,983
and Hill 364.

2165
01:47:11,023 --> 01:47:13,583
These young men
gave their lives.

2166
01:47:13,583 --> 01:47:17,583
So did Donny.

2167
01:47:17,623 --> 01:47:19,662
Donny who loved bowling.

2168
01:47:22,662 --> 01:47:28,582
And so, Theodore
Donald Karabatsos,

2169
01:47:28,622 --> 01:47:31,542
in accordance with
what we think

2170
01:47:31,582 --> 01:47:35,142
your dying wishes
might well have been,

2171
01:47:35,182 --> 01:47:39,062
We commit your final
mortal remains

2172
01:47:39,102 --> 01:47:43,062
To the bosom
of the pacific ocean,

2173
01:47:43,062 --> 01:47:45,182
which you loved so well.

2174
01:47:47,142 --> 01:47:49,222
Good night, sweet prince.

2175
01:48:07,662 --> 01:48:09,182
Oh, shit, Dude,
I'm sorry.

2176
01:48:11,662 --> 01:48:12,622
God damn wind.

2177
01:48:14,662 --> 01:48:16,182
You fucking asshole!

2178
01:48:17,182 --> 01:48:19,142
Everything's a fucking
travesty with you, man.

2179
01:48:19,142 --> 01:48:21,222
I'm sorry.
It was an accident.

2180
01:48:21,222 --> 01:48:23,182
What was that shit
About Vietnam?

2181
01:48:23,182 --> 01:48:25,142
What the fuck
does anything

2182
01:48:25,222 --> 01:48:26,782
have to do
with Vietnam?

2183
01:48:26,782 --> 01:48:28,142
What the fuck are
you talking about?

2184
01:48:44,221 --> 01:48:48,821
Come on, Dude.
Hey, fuck it, man.

2185
01:48:52,261 --> 01:48:53,741
Let's go bowling.

2186
01:49:17,141 --> 01:49:21,141
And when you're
sitting there

2187
01:49:21,181 --> 01:49:25,661
in your silk
upholstered chair

2188
01:49:25,661 --> 01:49:30,901
talkin' to some rich folks
that you know

2189
01:49:33,141 --> 01:49:37,261
well, I hope
you don't see me

2190
01:49:37,301 --> 01:49:41,181
in my ragged company

2191
01:49:41,221 --> 01:49:46,861
Aw, that you know
I could never be alone

2192
01:49:48,381 --> 01:49:50,381
2 oat sodas, Gary.

2193
01:49:50,421 --> 01:49:51,301
Good luck tomorrow.

2194
01:49:51,301 --> 01:49:52,821
Yeah, thanks, man.

2195
01:49:52,901 --> 01:49:54,861
I'm sorry to hear
about Donny.

2196
01:49:54,901 --> 01:49:58,261
Oh, well, yeah,
you know,

2197
01:49:58,301 --> 01:49:59,780
Sometimes you
eat the bar,

2198
01:49:59,820 --> 01:50:02,780
And sometimes,
you know

2199
01:50:06,380 --> 01:50:08,300
I wondered if I'd
see you again.

2200
01:50:08,300 --> 01:50:10,260
I wouldn't
miss the semis?

2201
01:50:10,300 --> 01:50:11,860
How have things
been going?

2202
01:50:11,900 --> 01:50:13,820
Oh, you know,
strikes and gutters,

2203
01:50:13,820 --> 01:50:15,300
ups and downs.

2204
01:50:16,860 --> 01:50:20,260
Yeah. Thanks, Gary.

2205
01:50:20,340 --> 01:50:22,940
Well, take care, man.
Gotta get back.

2206
01:50:25,780 --> 01:50:28,180
I know that you will.

2207
01:50:28,260 --> 01:50:32,420
Yeah, well,
The Dude abides.

2208
01:50:38,420 --> 01:50:41,540
The Dude abides.

2209
01:50:44,260 --> 01:50:48,860
I don't know about you,
but I take comfort in that.

2210
01:50:48,860 --> 01:50:52,740
It's good knowing he's
out there, The Dude.

2211
01:50:52,740 --> 01:50:56,220
Takin' her easy
for all us sinners.

2212
01:50:56,300 --> 01:51:01,740
Shoosh. I sure hope
he makes the finals.

2213
01:51:01,820 --> 01:51:03,780
Well, that about does her.

2214
01:51:03,780 --> 01:51:06,820
Wraps her all up.

2215
01:51:06,820 --> 01:51:08,780
Things seemed to have
worked out pretty good

2216
01:51:08,860 --> 01:51:11,220
for The Dude and Walter.

2217
01:51:11,260 --> 01:51:13,300
And it was
a pretty good story,

2218
01:51:13,340 --> 01:51:15,380
Don't you think?

2219
01:51:15,420 --> 01:51:18,340
Made me laugh
to beat the band.

2220
01:51:18,380 --> 01:51:21,219
Parts, anyway.

2221
01:51:21,259 --> 01:51:24,819
I didn't like
seeing Donny go.

2222
01:51:24,819 --> 01:51:26,339
But then
I happen to know

2223
01:51:26,339 --> 01:51:31,299
That there's a little
Lebowski on the way.

2224
01:51:31,379 --> 01:51:33,899
I guess that's how the
whole darn human comedy

2225
01:51:33,899 --> 01:51:37,819
keeps perpetuating itself

2226
01:51:37,899 --> 01:51:40,339
down through
the generations.

2227
01:51:40,379 --> 01:51:41,939
westward in the wagons,
